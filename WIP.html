Fremont, California. 1980s

Baba loved the idea of America.

It was living in America that gave him an ulcer.

I remember the two of us walking through Lake Elizabeth Park in Fremont, a few streets down from

our apartment, and watching boys at batting practice, little girls giggling on the swings in the

playground. Baba would enlighten me with his politics during those walks with long-winded

dissertations. “There are only three real men in this world, Amir,” he’d say. He’d count them off on

his fingers: America the brash savior, Britain, and Israel. “The rest of them--” he used to wave his

hand and make a phht sound “--they’re like gossiping old women.”

The bit about Israel used to draw the ire of Afghans in Fremont who accused him of being

pro-Jewish and, de facto, anti Islam. Baba would meet them for tea and rowt cake at the park, drive

them crazy with his politics. “What they don’t understand,” he’d tell me later, “is that religion has

nothing to do with it.” In Baba’s view, Israel was an island of “real men” in a sea of Arabs too busy

getting fat off their oil to care for their own. “Israel does this, Israel does that,” Baba would say in a

mock-Arabic accent. “Then do something about it! Take action. You’re Arabs, help the Palestinians,

then!”

He loathed Jimmy Carter, whom he called a “big-toothed cretin.” In 1980, when we were still in

Kabul, the U.S. announced it would be boycotting the Olympic Games in Moscow. “Wah wah!” Baba

exclaimed with disgust. “Brezhnev is massacring Afghans and all that peanut eater can say is I

won’t come swim in your pool.” Baba believed Carter had unwittingly done more for communism

than Leonid Brezhnev. “He’s not fit to run this country. It’s like putting a boy who can’t ride a bike

behind the wheel of a brand new Cadillac.” What America and the world needed was a hard man. A

man to be reckoned with, someone who took action instead of wringing his hands. That someone

came in the form of Ronald Reagan. And when Reagan went on TV and called the Shorawi “the Evil

Empire,” Baba went out and bought a picture of the grinning president giving a thumbs up. He

framed the picture and hung it in our hallway, nailing it right next to the old black-and-white of

himself in his thin necktie shaking hands with King Zahir Shah. Most of our neighbors in Fremont

were bus drivers, policemen, gas station attendants, and unwed mothers collecting welfare, exactly

the sort of blue-collar people who would soon suffocate under the pillow Reganomics pressed to

their faces. Baba was the lone Republican in our building.

But the Bay Area’s smog stung his eyes, the traffic noise gave him headaches, and the pollen

made him cough. The fruit was never sweet enough, the water never clean enough, and where were

all the trees and open fields? For two years, I tried to get Baba to enroll in ESL classes to improve his

broken English. But he scoffed at the idea. “Maybe I’ll spell ‘cat’ and the teacher will give me a

glittery little star so I can run home and show it off to you,” he’d grumble.

One Sunday in the spring of 1983, I walked into a small bookstore that sold used paperbacks, next

to the Indian movie theater just west of where Amtrak crossed Fremont Boulevard. I told Baba I’d be

out in five minutes and he shrugged. He had been working at a gas station in Fremont and had the

day off. I watched him jaywalk across Fremont Boulevard and enter Fast & Easy, a little grocery store

run by an elderly Vietnamese couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen. They were gray-haired, friendly people;

she had Parkinson’s, he’d had his hip replaced. “He’s like Six Million Dollar Man now,” she always

said to me, laughing toothlessly. “Remember Six Million Dollar Man, Amir?” Then Mr. Nguyen would

scowl like Lee Majors, pretend he was running in slow motion.

I was flipping through a worn copy of a Mike Hammer mystery when I heard screaming and glass

breaking. I dropped the book and hurried across the street. I found the Nguyens behind the counter,

all the way against the wall, faces ashen, Mr. Nguyen’s arms wrapped around his wife. On the floor:

oranges, an overturned magazine rack, a broken jar of beef jerky, and shards of glass at Baba’s feet.

It turned out that Baba had had no cash on him for the oranges. He’d written Mr. Nguyen a check

and Mr. Nguyen had asked for an ID. “He wants to see my license,” Baba bellowed in Farsi. “Almost

two years we’ve bought his damn fruits and put money in his pocket and the son of a dog wants to

see my license!”

“Baba, it’s not personal,” I said, smiling at the Nguyens. “They’re supposed to ask for an ID.”

“I don’t want you here,” Mr. Nguyen said, stepping in front of his wife. He was pointing at Baba

with his cane. He turned to me.

“You’re nice young man but your father, he’s crazy. Not welcome anymore.”

“Does he think I’m a thief?” Baba said, his voice rising. People had gathered outside. They were

staring. “What kind of a country is this? No one trusts anybody!”

“I call police,” Mrs. Nguyen said, poking out her face. “You get out or I call police.”

“Please, Mrs. Nguyen, don’t call the police. I’ll take him home. Just don’t call the police, okay?

Please?”

“Yes, you take him home. Good idea,” Mr. Nguyen said. His eyes, behind his wire-rimmed bifocals,

never left Baba. I led Baba through the doors. He kicked a magazine on his way out. After I’d made

him promise he wouldn’t go back in, I returned to the store and apologized to the Nguyens. Told

them my father was going through a difficult time. I gave Mrs. Nguyen our telephone number and

address, and told her to get an estimate for the damages. “Please call me as soon as you know. I’ll

pay for everything, Mrs. Nguyen. I’m so sorry.” Mrs. Nguyen took the sheet of paper from me and

nodded. I saw her hands were shaking more than usual, and that made me angry at Baba, his

causing an old woman to shake like that.

“My father is still adjusting to life in America,” I said, by way of explanation.

I wanted to tell them that, in Kabul, we snapped a tree branch and used it as a credit card. Hassan

and I would take the wooden stick to the bread maker. He’d carve notches on our stick with his knife,

one notch for each loaf of _naan_ he’d pull for us from the tandoor’s roaring flames. At the end of

the month, my father paid him for the number of notches on the stick. That was it. No questions. No

ID.

But I didn’t tell them. I thanked Mr. Nguyen for not calling the cops. Took Baba home. He sulked

and smoked on the balcony while I made rice with chicken neck stew. A year and a half since we’d

stepped off the Boeing from Peshawar, and Baba was still adjusting.

We ate in silence that night. After two bites, Baba pushed away his plate.

I glanced at him across the table, his nails chipped and black with engine oil, his knuckles scraped,

the smells of the gas station--dust, sweat, and gasoline--on his clothes. Baba was like the widower

who remarries but can’t let go of his dead wife. He missed the sugarcane fields of Jalalabad and the

gardens of Paghman. He missed people milling in and out of his house, missed walking down the

bustling aisles of Shor Bazaar and greeting people who knew him and his father, knew his

grandfather, people who shared ancestors with him, whose pasts intertwined with his.

For me, America was a place to bury my memories.

For Baba, a place to mourn his.

“Maybe we should go back to Peshawar,” I said, watching the ice float in my glass of water. We’d

spent six months in Peshawar waiting for the INS to issue our visas. Our grimy one-bedroom

apartment smelled like dirty socks and cat droppings, but we were surrounded by people we

knew--at least people Baba knew. He’d invite the entire corridor of neighbors for dinner, most of

them Afghans waiting for visas. Inevitably, someone would bring a set of tabla and someone else a

harmonium. Tea would brew, and who ever had a passing singing voice would sing until the sun

rose, the mosquitoes stopped buzzing, and clapping hands grew sore.

“You were happier there, Baba. It was more like home,” I said.

“Peshawar was good for me. Not good for you.”

“You work so hard here.”

“It’s not so bad now,” he said, meaning since he had become the day manager at the gas station.

But I’d seen the way he winced and rubbed his wrists on damp days. The way sweat erupted on his

forehead as he reached for his bottle of antacids after meals. “Besides, I didn’t bring us here for me,

did I?”

I reached across the table and put my hand on his. My student hand, clean and soft, on his

laborer’s hand, grubby and calloused. I thought of all the trucks, train sets, and bikes he’d bought

me in Kabul. Now America. One last gift for Amir.

Just one month after we arrived in the U.S., Baba found a job off Washington Boulevard as an

assistant at a gas station owned by an Afghan acquaintance--he’d started looking for work the same

week we arrived. Six days a week, Baba pulled twelve-hour shifts pumping gas, running the register,

changing oil, and washing windshields. I’d bring him lunch sometimes and find him looking for a

pack of cigarettes on the shelves, a customer waiting on the other side of the oil-stained counter,

Baba’s face drawn and pale under the bright fluorescent lights. The electronic bell over the door

would ding-dong when I walked in, and Baba would look over his shoulder, wave, and smile, his eyes

watering from fatigue.

The same day he was hired, Baba and I went to our eligibility officer in San Jose, Mrs. Dobbins. She

was an overweight black woman with twinkling eyes and a dimpled smile. She’d told me once that

she sang in church, and I believed her--she had a voice that made me think of warm milk and honey.

Baba dropped the stack of food stamps on her desk. “Thank you but I don’t want,” Baba said. “I

work always. In Afghanistan I work, in America I work. Thank you very much, Mrs. Dobbins, but I

don’t like it free money.”

Mrs. Dobbins blinked. Picked up the food stamps, looked from me to Baba like we were pulling a

prank, or “slipping her a trick” as Hassan used to say. “Fifteen years I been doin’ this job and

nobody’s ever done this,” she said. And that was how Baba ended those humiliating food stamp

moments at the cash register and alleviated one of his greatest fears: that an Afghan would see him

buying food with charity money. Baba walked out of the welfare office like a man cured of a tumor.

THAT SUMMER OF 1983, I graduated from high school at the age of twenty, by far the oldest senior

tossing his mortarboard on the football field that day. I remember losing Baba in the swarm of

families, flashing cameras, and blue gowns. I found him near the twenty-yard line, hands shoved in

his pockets, camera dangling on his chest. He disappeared and reappeared behind the people

moving between us: squealing blue-clad girls hugging, crying, boys high-fiving their fathers, each

other. Baba’s beard was graying, his hair thinning at the temples, and hadn’t he been taller in

Kabul? He was wearing his brown suit--his only suit, the same one he wore to Afghan weddings and

funerals--and the red tie I had bought for his fiftieth birthday that year. Then he saw me and waved.

Smiled. He motioned for me to wear my mortarboard, and took a picture of me with the school’s

clock tower in the background. I smiled for him--in a way, this was his day more than mine. He

walked to me, curled his arm around my neck, and gave my brow a single kiss. “I am moftakhir,

Amir,” he said. Proud. His eyes gleamed when he said that and I liked being on the receiving end of

that look.

He took me to an Afghan kabob house in Hayward that night and ordered far too much food. He

told the owner that his son was going to college in the fall. I had debated him briefly about that just

before graduation, and told him I wanted to get a job. Help out, save some money, maybe go to

college the following year. But he had shot me one of his smoldering Baba looks, and the words had

vaporized on my tongue.

After dinner, Baba took me to a bar across the street from the restaurant. The place was dim, and

the acrid smell of beer I’d always disliked permeated the walls. Men in baseball caps and tank tops

played pool, clouds of cigarette smoke hovering over the green tables, swirling in the fluorescent

light. We drew looks, Baba in his brown suit and me in pleated slacks and sports jacket. We took a

seat at the bar, next to an old man, his leathery face sickly in the blue glow of the Michelob sign

overhead. Baba lit a cigarette and ordered us beers. “Tonight I am too much happy,” he announced

to no one and everyone. “Tonight I drinking with my son. And one, please, for my friend,” he said,

patting the old man on the back. The old fellow tipped his hat and smiled. He had no upper teeth.

Baba finished his beer in three gulps and ordered another. He had three before I forced myself to

drink a quarter of mine. By then he had bought the old man a scotch and treated a foursome of pool

players to a pitcher of Budweiser. Men shook his hand and clapped him on the back. They drank to

him. Someone lit his cigarette. Baba loosened his tie and gave the old man a handful of quarters. He

pointed to the jukebox. “Tell him to play his favorite songs,” he said to me. The old man nodded and

gave Baba a salute. Soon, country music was blaring, and, just like that, Baba had started a party.

At one point, Baba stood, raised his beer, spilling it on the sawdust floor, and yelled, “Fuck the

Russia!” The bar’s laughter, then its full-throated echo followed. Baba bought another round of

pitchers for everyone.

When we left, everyone was sad to see him go. Kabul, Peshawar, Hayward. Same old Baba, I

thought, smiling.

I drove us home in Baba’s old, ochre yellow Buick Century. Baba dozed off on the way, snoring

like a jackhammer. I smelled tobacco on him and alcohol, sweet and pungent. But he sat up when I

stopped the car and said in a hoarse voice, “Keep driving to the end of the block.”

“Why, Baba?”

“Just go.” He had me park at the south end of the street. He reached in his coat pocket and handed

me a set of keys. “There,” he said, pointing to the car in front of us. It was an old model Ford, long

and wide, a dark color I couldn’t discern in the moon light. “It needs painting, and I’ll have one of the

guys at the station put in new shocks, but it runs.”

I took the keys, stunned. I looked from him to the car.

“You’ll need it to go to college,” he said.

I took his hand in mine. Squeezed it. My eyes were tearing over and I was glad for the shadows that

hid our faces. “Thank you, Baba.”

We got out and sat inside the Ford. It was a Grand Torino. Navy blue, Baba said. I drove it around

the block, testing the brakes, the radio, the turn signals. I parked it in the lot of our apartment

building and shut off the engine. “Tashakor, Baba jan,” I said. I wanted to say more, tell him how

touched I was by his act of kindness, how much I appreciated all that he had done for me, all that he

was still doing. But I knew I’d embarrass him. “Tashakor,” I repeated instead.

He smiled and leaned back against the headrest, his forehead almost touching the ceiling. We

didn’t say anything. Just sat in the dark, listened to the tink-tink of the engine cooling, the wail of a

siren in the distance. Then Baba rolled his head toward me. “I wish Hassan had been with us today,”

he said.

A pair of steel hands closed around my windpipe at the sound of Hassan’s name. I rolled down the

window. Waited for the steel hands to loosen their grip.

I WOULD ENROLL in junior college classes in the fall, I told Baba the day after graduation. He was

drinking cold black tea and chewing cardamom seeds, his personal trusted antidote for hang over

headaches.

“I think I’ll major in English,” I said. I winced inside, waiting for his reply.

“English?”

“Creative writing.”

He considered this. Sipped his tea. “Stories, you mean. You’ll make up stories.” I looked down at

my feet.

“They pay for that, making up stories?”

“If you’re good,” I said. “And if you get discovered.”

“How likely is that, getting discovered?”

“It happens,” I said.

He nodded. “And what will you do while you wait to get good and get discovered? How will you

earn money? If you marry, how will you support your khanum?”

I couldn’t lift my eyes to meet his. “I’ll... find a job.”

“Oh,” he said. “Wah wah! So, if I understand, you’ll study several years to earn a degree, then

you’ll get a chatti job like mine, one you could just as easily land today, on the small chance that

your degree might someday help you get... discovered.” He took a deep breath and sipped his tea.

Grunted something about medical school, law school, and “real work.”

My cheeks burned and guilt coursed through me, the guilt of indulging myself at the expense of his

ulcer, his black fingernails and aching wrists. But I would stand my ground, I decided. I didn’t want

to sacrifice for Baba anymore. The last time I had done that, I had damned myself.

Baba sighed and, this time, tossed a whole handful of car damom seeds in his mouth.

SOMETIMES, I GOT BEHIND the wheel of my Ford, rolled down the windows, and drove for hours,

from the East Bay to the South Bay, up the Peninsula and back. I drove through the grids of

cottonwood-lined streets in our Fremont neighborhood, where people who’d never shaken hands

with kings lived in shabby, flat one-story houses with barred windows, where old cars like mine

dripped oil on blacktop driveways. Pencil gray chain-link fences closed off the backyards in our

neighborhood. Toys, bald tires, and beer bottles with peeling labels littered unkempt front lawns. I

drove past tree-shaded parks that smelled like bark, past strip malls big enough to hold five

simultaneous Buzkashi tournaments. I drove the Torino up the hills of Los Altos, idling past estates

with picture windows and silver lions guarding the wrought-iron gates, homes with cherub fountains

lining the manicured walkways and no Ford Torinos in the drive ways. Homes that made Baba’s

house in Wazir Akbar Khan look like a servant’s hut.

I’d get up early some Saturday mornings and drive south on Highway 17, push the Ford up the

winding road through the mountains to Santa Cruz. I would park by the old lighthouse and wait for

sunrise, sit in my car and watch the fog rolling in from the sea. In Afghanistan, I had only seen the

ocean at the cinema. Sitting in the dark next to Hassan, I had always wondered if it was true what I’d

read, that sea air smelled like salt. I used to tell Hassan that someday we’d walk on a strip of

seaweed-strewn beach, sink our feet in the sand, and watch the water recede from our toes. The first

time I saw the Pacific, I almost cried. It was as vast and blue as the oceans on the movie screens of

my childhood.

Sometimes in the early evening, I parked the car and walked up a freeway overpass. My face

pressed against the fence, I’d try to count the blinking red taillights inching along, stretching as far

as my eyestould see. BMWs. Saabs. Porsches. Cars I’d never seen in Kabul, where most people

drove Russian Volgas, old Opels, or Iranian Paikans.

Almost two years had passed since we had arrived in the U.S., and I was still marveling at the size

of this country, its vastness. Beyond every freeway lay another freeway, beyond every city another

city hills beyond mountains and mountains beyond hills, and, beyond those, more cities and more

people.

Long before the Roussi army marched into Afghanistan, long before villages were burned and

schools destroyed, long before mines were planted like seeds of death and children buried in

rock-piled graves, Kabul had become a city of ghosts for me. A city of harelipped ghosts.

America was different. America was a river, roaring along, unmindful of the past. I could wade into

this river, let my sins drown to the bottom, let the waters carry me someplace far. Someplace with no

ghosts, no memories, and no sins.

If for nothing else, for that, I embraced America.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMER, the summer of 1984--the summer I turned twenty-one--Baba sold his

Buick and bought a dilapidated ’71 Volkswagen bus for $550 from an old Afghan acquaintance

who’d been a high-school science teacher in Kabul. The neighbors’ heads turned the afternoon the

bus sputtered up the street and farted its way across our lot. Baba killed the engine and let the bus

roll silently into our designated spot. We sank in our seats, laughed until tears rolled down our

cheeks, and, more important, until we were sure the neighbors weren’t watching anymore. The bus

was a sad carcass of rusted metal, shattered windows replaced with black garbage bags, balding

tires, and upholstery shredded down to the springs. But the old teacher had reassured Baba that the

engine and transmission were sound and, on that account, the man hadn’t lied.

On Saturdays, Baba woke me up at dawn. As he dressed, I scanned the classifieds in the local

papers and circled the garage sale ads. We mapped our route--Fremont, Union City, Newark, and

Hayward first, then San Jose, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, and Campbell if time permitted. Baba drove the

bus, sipping hot tea from the thermos, and I navigated. We stopped at garage sales and bought

knickknacks that people no longer wanted. We haggled over old sewing machines, one-eyed Barbie

dolls, wooden tennis rackets, guitars with missing strings, and old Electrolux vacuum cleaners. By

midafternoon, we’d filled the back of the VW bus with used goods. Then early Sunday mornings, we

drove to the San Jose flea market off Berryessa, rented a spot, and sold the junk for a small profit: a

Chicago record that we’d bought for a quarter the day before might go for $1, or $4 for a set of five; a

ramshackle Singer sewing machine purchased for $10 might, after some bargaining, bring in $25.

By that summer, Afghan families were working an entire section of the San Jose flea market.

Afghan music played in the aisles of the Used Goods section. There was an unspoken code of

behavior among Afghans at the flea market: You greeted the guy across the aisle, you invited him for

a bite of potato bolani or a little qabuli, and you chatted. You offered tassali, condolences, for the

death of a parent, congratulated the birth of children, and shook your head mournfully when the

conversation turned to Afghanistan and the Roussis--which it inevitably did. But you avoided the

topic of Saturday. Because it might turn out that the fellow across the isle was the guy you’d nearly

blindsided at the freeway exit yesterday in order to beat him to a promising garage sale.

The only thing that flowed more than tea in those aisles was Afghan gossip. The flea market was

where you sipped green tea with almond kolchas, and learned whose daughter had broken off an

engagement and run off with her American boyfriend, who used to be Parchami--a communist--in

Kabul, and who had bought a house with under-the-table money while still on welfare. Tea, Politics,

and Scandal, the ingredients of an Afghan Sunday at the flea market.

I ran the stand sometimes as Baba sauntered down the aisle, hands respectfully pressed to his

chest, greeting people he knew from Kabul: mechanics and tailors selling hand-me-down wool coats

and scraped bicycle helmets, alongside former ambassadors, out-of-work surgeons, and university

professors.

One early Sunday morning in July 1984, while Baba set up, I bought two cups of coffee from the

concession stand and returned to find Baba talking to an older, distinguished-looking man. I put the

cups on the rear bumper of the bus, next to the REAGAN/BUSH FOR ’84 sticker.

“Amir,” Baba said, motioning me over, “this is General Sahib, Mr. Iqbal Taheri. He was a decorated

general in Kabul. He worked for the Ministry of Defense.”

Taheri. Why did the name sound familiar? The general laughed like a man used to attending formal

parties where he’d laughed on cue at the minor jokes of important people. He had wispy silver-gray

hair combed back from his smooth, tanned forehead, and tufts of white in his bushy eye brows. He

smelled like cologne and wore an iron-gray three-piece suit, shiny from too many pressings; the gold

chain of a pocket watch dangled from his vest.

“Such a lofty introduction,” he said, his voice deep and cultured. “_Salaam, bachem_.” Hello, my

child.

“_Salaam_, General Sahib,” I said, shaking his hand. His thin hands belied a firm grip, as if steel

hid beneath the moisturized skin.

“Amir is going to be a great writer,” Baba said. I did a double take at this. “He has finished his first

year of college and earned A’s in all of his courses.”

“Junior college,” I corrected him.

“_Mashallah_,” General Taheri said. “Will you be writing about our country, history perhaps?

Economics?”

“I write fiction,” I said, thinking of the dozen or so short stories I had written in the leather-bound

notebook Rahim Khan had given me, wondering why I was suddenly embarrassed by them in this

man’s presence.

“Ah, a storyteller,” the general said. “Well, people need stories to divert them at difficult times like

this.” He put his hand on Baba’s shoulder and turned to me. “Speaking of stories, your father and I

hunted pheasant together one summer day in Jalalabad,” he said. “It was a marvelous time. If I recall

correctly, your father’s eye proved as keen in the hunt as it had in business.”

Baba kicked a wooden tennis racket on our tarpaulin spread with the toe of his boot. “Some

business.”

General Taheri managed a simultaneously sad and polite smile, heaved a sigh, and gently patted

Baba’s shoulder. “Zendagi migzara,” he said. Life goes on. He turned his eyes to me. “We Afghans

are prone to a considerable degree of exaggeration, bachem, and I have heard many men foolishly

labeled great. But your father has the distinction of belonging to the minority who truly deserves the

label.” This little speech sounded to me the way his suit looked: often used and unnaturally shiny.

“You’re flattering me,” Baba said.

“I am not,” the general said, tilting his head sideways and pressing his hand to his chest to convey

humility. “Boys and girls must know the legacy of their fathers.” He turned to me. “Do you appreciate

your father, bachem? Do you really appreciate him?”

“Balay, General Sahib, I do,” I said, wishing he’d not call me “my child.”

“Then congratulations, you are already halfway to being a man,” he said with no trace of humor, no

irony, the compliment of the casually arrogant.

“Padar jan, you forgot your tea.” A young woman’s voice. She was standing behind us, a

slim-hipped beauty with velvety coal black hair, an open thermos and Styrofoam cup in her hand. I

blinked, my heart quickening. She had thick black eyebrows that touched in the middle like the

arched wings of a flying bird, and the gracefully hooked nose of a princess from old Persia--maybe

that of Tahmineh, Rostam’s wife and Sohrab’s mother from the _Shahnamah_. Her eyes, walnut

brown and shaded by fanned lashes, met mine. Held for a moment. Flew away.

“You are so kind, my dear,” General Taheri said. He took the cup from her. Before she turned to go,

I saw she had a brown, sickle-shaped birthmark on the smooth skin just above her left jawline. She

walked to a dull gray van two aisles away and put the thermos inside. Her hair spilled to one side

when she kneeled amid boxes of old records and paperbacks.

“My daughter, Soraya jan,” General Taheri said. He took a deep breath like a man eager to change

the subject and checked his gold pocket watch. “Well, time to go and set up.” He and Baba kissed on

the cheek and he shook my hand with both of his. “Best of luck with the writing,” he said, looking me

in the eye. His pale blue eyes revealed nothing of the thoughts behind them.

For the rest of that day, I fought the urge to look toward the gray van.

IT CAME TO ME on our way home. Taheri, I knew I’d heard that name before.

“Wasn’t there some story floating around about Taheri’s daughter?” I said to Baba, trying to

sound casual.

“You know me,” Baba said, inching the bus along the queue exiting the flea market. “Talk turns to

gossip and I walk away.”

“But there was, wasn’t there?” I said.

“Why do you ask?” He was looking at me coyly.

I shrugged and fought back a smile. “Just curious, Baba.”

“Really? Is that all?” he said, his eyes playful, lingering on mine. “Has she made an impression on

you?”

I rolled my eyes. “Please, Baba.”

He smiled, and swung the bus out of the flea market. We headed for Highway 680. We drove in

silence for a while. “All I’ve heard is that there was a man once and things... didn’t go well.” He said

this gravely, like he’d disclosed to me that she had breast cancer.

“I hear she is a decent girl, hardworking and kind. But no khastegars, no suitors, have knocked on

the general’s door since.” Baba sighed. “It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days,

sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime, Amir,” he said.

LYING AWAKE IN BED that night, I thought of Soraya Taheri’s sickle-shaped birthmark, her gently

hooked nose, and the way her luminous eyes had fleetingly held mine. My heart stuttered at the

thought of her. Soraya Taheri. My Swap Meet Princess.

TWELVE

In Afghanistan, _yelda_ is the first night of the month of _Jadi_, the first night of winter, and the

longest night of the year. As was the tradition, Hassan and I used to stay up late, our feet tucked

under the kursi, while Ali tossed apple skin into the stove and told us ancient tales of sultans and

thieves to pass that longest of nights. It was from Ali that I learned the lore of _yelda_, that bedeviled

moths flung themselves at candle flames, and wolves climbed mountains looking for the sun. Ali

swore that if you ate water melon the night of _yelda_, you wouldn’t get thirsty the coming summer.

When I was older, I read in my poetry books that _yelda_ was the starless night tormented lovers

kept vigil, enduring the endless dark, waiting for the sun to rise and bring with it their loved one.

After I met Soraya Taheri, every night of the week became a _yelda_ for me. And when Sunday

mornings came, I rose from bed, Soraya Taheri’s brown-eyed face already in my head. In Baba’s

bus, I counted the miles until I’d see her sitting barefoot, arranging cardboard boxes of yellowed

encyclopedias, her heels white against the asphalt, silver bracelets jingling around her slender

wrists. I’d think of the shadow her hair cast on the ground when it slid off her back and hung down

like a velvet curtain. Soraya. Swap Meet Princess. The morning sun to my yelda.

I invented excuses to stroll down the aisle--which Baba acknowledged with a playful smirk--and

pass the Taheris’ stand. I would wave at the general, perpetually dressed in his shiny overpressed

gray suit, and he would wave back. Sometimes he’d get up from his director’s chair and we’d make

small talk about my writing, the war, the day’s bargains. And I’d have to will my eyes not to peel

away, not to wander to where Soraya sat reading a paperback. The general and I would say our

good-byes and I’d try not to slouch as I walked away.

Sometimes she sat alone, the general off to some other row to socialize, and I would walk by,

pretending not to know her, but dying to. Sometimes she was there with a portly middle-aged woman

with pale skin and dyed red hair. I promised myself that I would talk to her before the summer was

over, but schools reopened, the leaves reddened, yellowed, and fell, the rains of winter swept in and

wakened Baba’s joints, baby leaves sprouted once more, and I still hadn’t had the heart, the dil, to

even look her in the eye.

The spring quarter ended in late May 1985. I aced all of my general education classes, which was a

minor miracle given how I’d sit in lectures and think of the soft hook of Soraya’s nose.

Then, one sweltering Sunday that summer, Baba and I were at the flea market, sitting at our booth,

fanning our faces with news papers. Despite the sun bearing down like a branding iron, the market

was crowded that day and sales had been strong--it was only 12:30 but we’d already made $160. I

got up, stretched, and asked Baba if he wanted a Coke. He said he’d love one.

“Be careful, Amir,” he said as I began to walk. “Of what, Baba?”

“I am not an ahmaq, so don’t play stupid with me.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Remember this,” Baba said, pointing at me, “The man is a Pashtun to the root. He has nang and

namoos.” Nang. Namoos. Honor and pride. The tenets of Pashtun men. Especially when it came to

the chastity of a wife. Or a daughter.

“I’m only going to get us drinks.”

“Just don’t embarrass me, that’s all I ask.”

“I won’t. God, Baba.”

Baba lit a cigarette and started fanning himself again.

I walked toward the concession booth initially, then turned left at the T-shirt stand--where, for $5,

you could have the face of Jesus, Elvis, Jim Morrison, or all three, pressed on a white nylon T-shirt.

Mariachi music played overhead, and I smelled pickles and grilled meat.

I spotted the Taheris’ gray van two rows from ours, next to a kiosk selling mango-on-a-stick. She

was alone, reading. White ankle-length summer dress today. Open-toed sandals. Hair pulled back

and crowned with a tulip-shaped bun. I meant to simply walk by again and I thought I had, except

suddenly I was standing at the edge of the Taheris’ white tablecloth, staring at Soraya across curling

irons and old neckties. She looked up.

“Salaam,” I said. “I’m sorry to be mozahem, I didn’t mean to disturb you.”

“Salaam.”

“Is General Sahib here today?” I said. My ears were burning. I couldn’t bring myself to look her in

the eye.

“He went that way,” she said. Pointed to her right. The bracelet slipped down to her elbow, silver

against olive.

“Will you tell him I stopped by to pay my respects?” I said.

“I will.”

“Thank you,” I said. “Oh, and my name is Amir. In case you need to know. So you can tell him. That

I stopped by. To... pay my respects.”

“Yes.”

I shifted on my feet, cleared my throat. “I’ll go now. Sorry to have disturbed you.”

“Nay, you didn’t,” she said.

“Oh. Good.” I tipped my head and gave her a half smile. “I’ll go now.” Hadn’t I already said that?

“Khoda hãfez.”

“Khoda hãfez.”

I began to walk. Stopped and turned. I said it before I had a chance to lose my nerve: “Can I ask

what you’re reading?”

She blinked.

I held my breath. Suddenly, I felt the collective eyes of the flea market Afghans shift to us. I

imagined a hush falling. Lips stop ping in midsentence. Heads turning. Eyes narrowing with keen

interest.

What was this?

Up to that point, our encounter could have been interpreted as a respectful inquiry, one man asking

for the whereabouts of another man. But I’d asked her a question and if she answered, we’d be...

well, we’d be chatting. Me a mojarad, a single young man, and she an unwed young woman. One

with a history, no less. This was teetering dangerously on the verge of gossip material, and the best

kind of it. Poison tongues would flap. And she would bear the brunt of that poison, not me--I was

fully aware of the Afghan double standard that favored my gender. Not Did you see him chatting with

her? but Wooooy! Did you see how she wouldn’t let him go? What a lochak!

By Afghan standards, my question had been bold. With it, I had bared myself, and left little doubt

as to my interest in her. But I was a man, and all I had risked was a bruised ego. Bruises healed.

Reputations did not. Would she take my dare?

She turned the book so the cover faced me. Wuthering Heights. “Have you read it?” she said.

I nodded. I could feel the pulsating beat of my heart behind my eyes. “It’s a sad story.”

“Sad stories make good books,” she said.

“They do.”

“I heard you write.”

How did she know? I wondered if her father had told her, maybe she had asked him. I immediately

dismissed both scenarios as absurd. Fathers and sons could talk freely about women. But no Afghan

girl--no decent and mohtaram Afghan girl, at least--queried her father about a young man. And no

father, especially a Pashtun with nang and namoos, would discuss a mojarad with his daughter, not

unless the fellow in question was a khastegar, a suitor, who had done the honorable thing and sent

his father to knock on the door.

Incredibly, I heard myself say, “Would you like to read one of my stories?”

“I would like that,” she said. I sensed an unease in her now, saw it in the way her eyes began to

flick side to side. Maybe checking for the general. I wondered what he would say if he found me

speaking for such an inappropriate length of time with his daughter.

“Maybe I’ll bring you one someday,” I said. I was about to say more when the woman I’d seen on

occasion with Soraya came walking up the aisle. She was carrying a plastic bag full of fruit. When

she saw us, her eyes bounced from Soraya to me and back. She smiled.

“Amir jan, good to see you,” she said, unloading the bag on the tablecloth. Her brow glistened with

a sheen of sweat. Her red hair, coiffed like a helmet, glittered in the sunlight--I could see bits of her

scalp where the hair had thinned. She had small green eyes buried in a cabbage-round face, capped

teeth, and little fingers like sausages. A golden Allah rested on her chest, the chain burrowed under

the skin tags and folds of her neck. “I am Jamila, Soraya jan’s mother.”

“Salaam, Khala jan,” I said, embarrassed, as I often was around Afghans, that she knew me and I

had no idea who she was.

“How is your father?” she said.

“He’s well, thank you.”

“You know, your grandfather, Ghazi Sahib, the judge? Now, his uncle and my grandfather were

cousins,” she said. “So you see, we’re related.” She smiled a cap-toothed smile, and I noticed the

right side of her mouth drooping a little. Her eyes moved between Soraya and me again.

I’d asked Baba once why General Taheri’s daughter hadn’t married yet. No suitors, Baba said. No

suitable suitors, he amended. But he wouldn’t say more--Baba knew how lethal idle talk could prove

to a young woman’s prospects of marrying well. Afghan men, especially those from reputable

families, were fickle creatures. A whisper here, an insinuation there, and they fled like startled birds.

So weddings had come and gone and no one had sung ahesta boro for Soraya, no one had painted

her palms with henna, no one had held a Koran over her headdress, and it had been General Taheri

who’d danced with her at every wedding.

And now, this woman, this mother, with her heartbreakingly eager, crooked smile and the barely

veiled hope in her eyes. I cringed a little at the position of power I’d been granted, and all because I

had won at the genetic lottery that had determined my sex.

I could never read the thoughts in the general’s eyes, but I knew this much about his wife: If I was

going to have an adversary in this--whatever this was--it would not be her.

“Sit down, Amir jan,” she said. “Soraya, get him a chair, hachem. And wash one of those peaches.

They’re sweet and fresh.”

“Nay, thank you,” I said. “I should get going. My father’s waiting.”

“Oh?” Khanum Taheri said, clearly impressed that I’d done the polite thing and declined the offer.

“Then here, at least have this.” She threw a handful of kiwis and a few peaches into a paper bag and

insisted I take them. “Carry my Salaam to your father. And come back to see us again.”

“I will. Thank you, Khala jan,” I said. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Soraya looking away.

“I THOUGHT YOU WERE GETTING COKES,” Baba said, taking the bag of peaches from me. He was

looking at me in a simultaneously serious and playful way. I began to make some thing up, but he bit

into a peach and waved his hand, “Don’t bother, Amir. Just remember what I said.”

THAT NIGHT IN BED, I thought of the way dappled sunlight had danced in Soraya’s eyes, and of

the delicate hollows above her collarbone. I replayed our conversation over and over in my head.

Had she said I heard you write or I heard you’re a writer? Which was it? I tossed in my sheets and

stared at the ceiling, dismayed at the thought of six laborious, interminable nights of yelda until I saw

her again.

IT WENT ON LIKE THAT for a few weeks. I’d wait until the general went for a stroll, then I’d walk

past the Taheris’ stand. If Khanum Taheri was there, she’d offer me tea and a kolcha and we’d chat

about Kabul in the old days, the people we knew, her arthritis. Undoubtedly, she had noticed that my

appearances always coincided with her husband’s absences, but she never let on. “Oh you just

missed your Kaka,” she’d say. I actually liked it when Khanum Taheri was there, and not just

because of her amiable ways; Soraya was more relaxed, more talkative with her mother around. As if

her presence legitimized whatever was happening between us--though certainly not to the same

degree that the general’s would have. Khanum Taheri’s chaperoning made our meetings, if not

gossip-proof, then less gossip-worthy, even if her borderline fawning on me clearly embarrassed

Soraya.

One day, Soraya and I were alone at their booth, talking. She was telling me about school, how she

too was working on her general education classes, at Ohlone Junior College in Fremont.

“What will you major in?”

“I want to be a teacher,” she said.

“Really? Why?”

“I’ve always wanted to. When we lived in Virginia, I became ESL certified and now I teach at the

public library one night a week. My mother was a teacher too, she taught Farsi and history at

Zarghoona High School for girls in Kabul.”

A potbellied man in a deerstalker hat offered three dollars for a five-dollar set of candlesticks and

Soraya let him have it. She dropped the money in a little candy box by her feet. She looked at me

shyly. “I want to tell you a story,” she said, “but I’m a little embarrassed about it.”

“Tell me.”

“It’s kind of silly.”

“Please tell me.”

She laughed. “Well, when I was in fourth grade in Kabul, my father hired a woman named Ziba to

help around the house. She had a sister in Iran, in Mashad, and, since Ziba was illiterate, she’d ask

me to write her sister letters once in a while. And when the sister replied, I’d read her letter to Ziba.

One day, I asked her if she’d like to learn to read and write. She gave me this big smile, crinkling her

eyes, and said she’d like that very much. So we’d sit at the kitchen table after I was done with my

own schoolwork and I’d teach her Alef-beh. I remember looking up sometimes in the middle of

homework and seeing Ziba in the kitchen, stirring meat in the pressure cooker, then sitting down

with a pencil to do the alphabet homework I’d assigned to her the night before.

“Anyway, within a year, Ziba could read children’s books. We sat in the yard and she read me the

tales of Dara and Sara--slowly but correctly. She started calling me Moalem Soraya, Teacher Soraya.”

She laughed again. “I know it sounds childish, but the first time Ziba wrote her own letter, I knew

there was nothing else I’d ever want to be but a teacher. I was so proud of her and I felt I’d done

something really worthwhile, you know?”

“Yes,” I lied. I thought of how I had used my literacy to ridicule Hassan. How I had teased him about

big words he didn’t know.

“My father wants me to go to law school, my mother’s always throwing hints about medical school,

but I’m going to be a teacher. Doesn’t pay much here, but it’s what I want.”

“My mother was a teacher too,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “My mother told me.” Then her face red dened with a blush at what she had

blurted, at the implication of her answer, that “Amir Conversations” took place between them when I

wasn’t there. It took an enormous effort to stop myself from smiling.

“I brought you something.” I fished the roll of stapled pages from my back pocket. “As promised.” I

handed her one of my short stories.

“Oh, you remembered,” she said, actually beaming. “Thank you!” I barely had time to register that

she’d addressed me with “tu” for the first time and not the formal “shoma,” because suddenly her

smile vanished. The color dropped from her face, and her eyes fixed on something behind me. I

turned around. Came face-to-face with General Taheri.

“Amir jan. Our aspiring storyteller. What a pleasure,” he said. He was smiling thinly.

“Salaam, General Sahib,” I said through heavy lips.

He moved past me, toward the booth. “What a beautiful day it is, nay?” he said, thumb hooked in

the breast pocket of his vest, the other hand extended toward Soraya. She gave him the pages.

“They say it will rain this week. Hard to believe, isn’t it?” He dropped the rolled pages in the

garbage can. Turned to me and gently put a hand on my shoulder. We took a few steps together.

“You know, bachem, I have grown rather fond of you. You are a decent boy, I really believe that,

but--” he sighed and waved a hand “--even decent boys need reminding sometimes. So it’s my duty

to remind you that you are among peers in this flea market.” He stopped. His expressionless eyes

bore into mine. “You see, everyone here is a storyteller.” He smiled, revealing perfectly even teeth.

“Do pass my respects to your father, Amir jan.”

He dropped his hand. Smiled again.

“WHAT’S WRONG?” Baba said. He was taking an elderly woman’s money for a rocking horse.

“Nothing,” I said. I sat down on an old TV set. Then I told him anyway.

“Akh, Amir,” he sighed.

As it turned out, I didn’t get to brood too much over what had happened.

Because later that week, Baba caught a cold.

IT STARTED WITH A HACKING COUGH and the sniffles. He got over the sniffles, but the cough

persisted. He’d hack into his handkerchief, stow it in his pocket. I kept after him to get it checked,

but he’d wave me away. He hated doctors and hospitals. To my knowledge, the only time Baba had

ever gone to a doctor was the time he’d caught malaria in India.

Then, two weeks later, I caught him coughing a wad of blood-stained phlegm into the toilet.

“How long have you been doing that?” I said.

“What’s for dinner?” he said.

“I’m taking you to the doctor.”

Even though Baba was a manager at the gas station, the owner hadn’t offered him health

insurance, and Baba, in his recklessness, hadn’t insisted. So I took him to the county hospital in San

Jose. The sallow, puffy-eyed doctor who saw us introduced himself as a second-year resident. “He

looks younger than you and sicker than me,” Baba grumbled. The resident sent us down for a chest

X-ray. When the nurse called us back in, the resident was filling out a form.

“Take this to the front desk,” he said, scribbling quickly.

“What is it?” I asked.

“A referral.” Scribble scribble.

“For what?”

“Pulmonary clinic.”

“What’s that?”

He gave me a quick glance. Pushed up his glasses. Began scribbling again. “He’s got a spot on his

right lung. I want them to check it out.”

“A spot?” I said, the room suddenly too small.

“Cancer?” Baba added casually.

“Possible. It’s suspicious, anyway,” the doctor muttered.

“Can’t you tell us more?” I asked.

“Not really. Need a CAT scan first, then see the lung doctor.” He handed me the referral form. “You

said your father smokes, right?”

“Yes.”

He nodded. Looked from me to Baba and back again. “They’ll call you within two weeks.”

I wanted to ask him how I was supposed to live with that word, “suspicious,” for two whole weeks.

How was I supposed eat, work, study? How could he send me home with that word?

I took the form and turned it in. That night, I waited until Baba fell asleep, and then folded a blanket.

I used it as a prayer rug. Bowing my head to the ground, I recited half-forgotten verses from the

Koran--verses the mullah had made us commit to memory in Kabul--and asked for kindness from a

God I wasn’t sure existed. I envied the mullah now, envied his faith and certainty.

Two weeks passed and no one called. And when I called them, they told me they’d lost the referral.

Was I sure I had turned it in? They said they would call in another three weeks. I raised hell and

bargained the three weeks down to one for the CAT scan, two to see the doctor.

The visit with the pulmonologist, Dr. Schneider, was going well until Baba asked him where he was

from. Dr. Schneider said Russia. Baba lost it.

“Excuse us, Doctor,” I said, pulling Baba aside. Dr. Schneider smiled and stood back, stethoscope

still in hand.

“Baba, I read Dr. Schneider’s biography in the waiting room. He was born in Michigan. Michigan!

He’s American, a lot more American than you and I will ever be.”

“I don’t care where he was born, he’s Roussi,” Baba said, grimacing like it was a dirty word. “His

parents were Roussi, his grandparents were Roussi. I swear on your mother’s face I’ll break his arm

if he tries to touch me.”

“Dr. Schneider’s parents fled from Shorawi, don’t you see? They escaped!”

But Baba would hear none of it. Sometimes I think the only thing he loved as much as his late wife

was Afghanistan, his late country. I almost screamed with frustration. Instead, I sighed and turned to

Dr. Schneider. “I’m sorry, Doctor. This isn’t going to work out.”

The next pulmonologist, Dr. Amani, was Iranian and Baba approved. Dr. Amani, a soft-spoken man

with a crooked mustache and a mane of gray hair, told us he had reviewed the CAT scan results and

that he would have to perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy to get a piece of the lung mass for

pathology. He scheduled it for the following week. I thanked him as I helped Baba out of the office,

thinking that now I had to live a whole week with this new word, “mass,” an even more ominous word

than “suspicious.” I wished Soraya were there with me.

It turned out that, like Satan, cancer had many names. Baba’s was called “Oat Cell Carcinoma.”

Advanced. Inoperable. Baba asked Dr. Amani for a prognosis. Dr. Amani bit his lip, used the word

“grave.” “There is chemotherapy, of course,” he said. “But it would only be palliative.”

“What does that mean?” Baba asked.

Dr. Amani sighed. “It means it wouldn’t change the outcome, just prolong it.”

“That’s a clear answer, Dr. Amani. Thank you for that,” Baba said. “But no chemo-medication for

me.” He had the same resolved look on his face as the day he’d dropped the stack of food stamps

on Mrs. Dobbins’s desk.

“But Baba--”

“Don’t you challenge me in public, Amir. Ever. Who do you think you are?”

THE RAIN General Taheri had spoken about at the flea market was a few weeks late, but when we

stepped out of Dr. Amani’s office, passing cars sprayed grimy water onto the sidewalks. Baba lit a

cigarette. He smoked all the way to the car and all the way home.

As he was slipping the key into the lobby door, I said, “I wish you’d give the chemo a chance,

Baba.”

Baba pocketed the keys, pulled me out of the rain and under the building’s striped awning. He

kneaded me on the chest with the hand holding the cigarette. “Bas! I’ve made my decision.”

“What about me, Baba? What am I supposed to do?” I said, my eyes welling up.

A look of disgust swept across his rain-soaked face. It was the same look he’d give me when, as a

kid, I’d fall, scrape my knees, and cry. It was the crying that brought it on then, the crying that

brought it on now. “You’re twenty-two years old, Amir! A grown man! You...” he opened his mouth,

closed it, opened it again, reconsidered. Above us, rain drummed on the canvas awning. “What’s

going to happen to you, you say? All those years, that’s what I was trying to teach you, how to never

have to ask that question.”

He opened the door. Turned back to me. “And one more thing. No one finds out about this, you

hear me? No one. I don’t want anybody’s sympathy.” Then he disappeared into the dim lobby. He

chain-smoked the rest of that day in front of the TV. I didn’t know what or whom he was defying. Me?

Dr. Amani? Or maybe the God he had never believed in.

FOR A WHILE, even cancer couldn’t keep Baba from the flea market. We made our garage sale

treks on Saturdays, Baba the driver and me the navigator, and set up our display on Sundays. Brass

lamps. Baseball gloves. Ski jackets with broken zippers. Baba greeted acquaintances from the old

country and I haggled with buyers over a dollar or two. Like any of it mattered. Like the day I would

become an orphan wasn’t inching closer with each closing of shop.

Sometimes, General Taheri and his wife strolled by. The general, ever the diplomat, greeted me

with a smile and his two-handed shake. But there was a new reticence to Khanum Taheri’s

demeanor. A reticence broken only by her secret, droopy smiles and the furtive, apologetic looks she

cast my way when the general’s attention was engaged elsewhere.

I remember that period as a time of many “firsts”: The first time I heard Baba moan in the

bathroom. The first time I found blood on his pillow. In over three years running the gas station, Baba

had never called in sick. Another first.

By Halloween of that year, Baba was getting so tired by mid-Saturday afternoon that he’d wait

behind the wheel while I got out and bargained for junk. By Thanksgiving, he wore out before noon.

When sleighs appeared on front lawns and fake snow on Douglas firs, Baba stayed home and I drove

the VW bus alone up and down the peninsula.

Sometimes at the flea market, Afghan acquaintances made remarks about Baba’s weight loss. At

first, they were complimentary. They even asked the secret to his diet. But the queries and

compliments stopped when the weight loss didn’t. When the pounds kept shedding. And shedding.

When his cheeks hollowed. And his temples melted. And his eyes receded in their sockets.

Then, one cool Sunday shortly after New Year’s Day, Baba was selling a lampshade to a stocky

Filipino man while I rummaged in the VW for a blanket to cover his legs with.

“Hey, man, this guy needs help!” the Filipino man said with alarm. I turned around and found Baba

on the ground. His arms and legs were jerking.

“Komak!” I cried. “Somebody help!” I ran to Baba. He was frothing at the mouth, the foamy spittle

soaking his beard. His upturned eyes showed nothing but white.

People were rushing to us. I heard someone say seizure. Some one else yelling, “Call 911!” I heard

running footsteps. The sky darkened as a crowd gathered around us.

Baba’s spittle turned red. He was biting his tongue. I kneeled beside him and grabbed his arms and

said I’m here Baba, I’m here, you’ll be all right, I’m right here. As if I could soothe the convulsions

out of him. Talk them into leaving my Baba alone. I felt a wetness on my knees. Saw Baba’s bladder

had let go. Shhh, Baba jan, I’m here. Your son is right here.

THE DOCTOR, white-bearded and perfectly bald, pulled me out of the room. “I want to go over your

father’s CAT scans with you,” he said. He put the films up on a viewing box in the hallway and

pointed with the eraser end of his pencil to the pictures of Baba’s cancer, like a cop showing mug

shots of the killer to the victim’s family. Baba’s brain on those pictures looked like cross sections of

a big walnut, riddled with tennis ball-shaped gray things.

“As you can see, the cancer’s metastasized,” he said. “He’ll have to take steroids to reduce the

swelling in his brain and antiseizure medications. And I’d recommend palliative radiation. Do you

know what that means?”

I said I did. I’d become conversant in cancer talk.

“All right, then,” he said. He checked his beeper. “I have to go, but you can have me paged if you

have any questions.”

“Thank you.”

I spent the night sitting on a chair next to Baba’s bed.

THE NEXT MORNING, the waiting room down the hall was jammed with Afghans. The butcher from

Newark. An engineer who’d worked with Baba on his orphanage. They filed in and paid Baba their

respects in hushed tones. Wished him a swift recovery. Baba was awake then, groggy and tired, but

awake.

Midmorning, General Taheri and his wife came. Soraya followed. We glanced at each other, looked

away at the same time. “How are you, my friend?” General Taheri said, taking Baba’s hand.

Baba motioned to the IV hanging from his arm. Smiled thinly. The general smiled back.

“You shouldn’t have burdened yourselves. All of you,” Baba croaked.

“It’s no burden,” Khanum Taheri said.

“No burden at all. More importantly, do you need anything?” General Taheri said. “Anything at all?

Ask me like you’d ask a brother.”

I remembered something Baba had said about Pashtuns once. We may be hardheaded and I know

we’re far too proud, but, in the hour of need, believe me that there’s no one you’d rather have at

your side than a Pashtun.

Baba shook his head on the pillow. “Your coming here has brightened my eyes.” The general

smiled and squeezed Baba’s hand. “How are you, Amir jan? Do you need anything?”

The way he was looking at me, the kindness in his eyes... “Nay thank you, General Sahib. I’m...“ A

lump shot up in my throat and my eyes teared over. I bolted out of the room.

I wept in the hallway, by the viewing box where, the night before, I’d seen the killer’s face.

Baba’s door opened and Soraya walked out of his room. She stood near me. She was wearing a

gray sweatshirt and jeans. Her hair was down. I wanted to find comfort in her arms.

“I’m so sorry, Amir,” she said. “We all knew something was wrong, but we had no idea it was this.”

I blotted my eyes with my sleeve. “He didn’t want anyone to know.”

“Do you need anything?”

“No.” I tried to smile. She put her hand on mine. Our first touch. I took it. Brought it to my face. My

eyes. I let it go. “You’d better go back inside. Or your father will come after me.”

She smiled and nodded. “I should.” She turned to go. “Soraya?”

“Yes?”

“I’m happy you came, It means... the world to me.”

THEY DISCHARGED BABA two days later. They brought in a specialist called a radiation oncologist

to talk Baba into getting radiation treatment. Baba refused. They tried to talk me into talking him into

it. But I’d seen the look on Baba’s face. I thanked them, signed their forms, and took Baba home in

my Ford Torino.

That night, Baba was lying on the couch, a wool blanket covering him. I brought him hot tea and

roasted almonds. Wrapped my arms around his back and pulled him up much too easily. His

shoulder blade felt like a bird’s wing under my fingers. I pulled the blanket back up to his chest

where ribs stretched his thin, sallow skin.

“Can I do anything else for you, Baba?”

“Nay, bachem. Thank you.”

I sat beside him. “Then I wonder if you’ll do something for me. If you’re not too exhausted.”

“What?”

“I want you to go khastegari. I want you to ask General Taheri for his daughter’s hand.”

Baba’s dry lips stretched into a smile. A spot of green on a wilted leaf. “Are you sure?”

“More sure than I’ve ever been about anything.”

“You’ve thought it over?”

“Balay, Baba.”

“Then give me the phone. And my little notebook.”

I blinked. “Now?”

“Then when?”

I smiled. “Okay.” I gave him the phone and the little black notebook where Baba had scribbled his

Afghan friends’ numbers.

He looked up the Taheris. Dialed. Brought the receiver to his ear. My heart was doing pirouettes in

my chest.

“Jamila jan? Salaam alaykum,” he said. He introduced himself. Paused. “Much better, thank you. It

was so gracious of you to come.” He listened for a while. Nodded. “I’ll remember that, thank you. Is

General Sahib home?” Pause. “Thank you.”

His eyes flicked to me. I wanted to laugh for some reason. Or scream. I brought the ball of my hand

to my mouth and bit on it. Baba laughed softly through his nose.

“General Sahib, Salaam alaykum... Yes, much much better... Balay... You’re so kind. General Sahib,

I’m calling to ask if I may pay you and Khanum Taheri a visit tomorrow morning. It’s an honorable

matter... Yes... Eleven o’clock is just fine. Until then. Khoda hãfez.”

He hung up. We looked at each other. I burst into giggles. Baba joined in.

BABA WET HIS HAIR and combed it back. I helped him into a clean white shirt and knotted his tie

for him, noting the two inches of empty space between the collar button and Baba’s neck. I thought

of all the empty spaces Baba would leave behind when he was gone, and I made myself think of

something else. He wasn’t gone. Not yet. And this was a day for good thoughts. The jacket of his

brown suit, the one he’d worn to my graduation, hung over him--too much of Baba had melted away

to fill it anymore. I had to roll up the sleeves. I stooped and tied his shoelaces for him.

The Taheris lived in a flat, one-story house in one of the residential areas in Fremont known for

housing a large number of Afghans. It had bay windows, a pitched roof, and an enclosed front porch

on which I saw potted geraniums. The general’s gray van was parked in the driveway.

I helped Baba out of the Ford and slipped back behind the wheel. He leaned in the passenger

window. “Be home, I’ll call you in an hour.”

“Okay, Baba,” I said. “Good luck.”

He smiled.

I drove away. In the rearview mirror, Baba was hobbling up the Taheris’ driveway for one last

fatherly duty.

I PACED THE LIVING ROOM of our apartment waiting for Baba’s call. Fifteen paces long. Ten and a

half paces wide. What if the general said no? What if he hated me? I kept going to the kitchen,

checking the oven clock.

The phone rang just before noon. It was Baba.

“Well?”

“The general accepted.”

I let out a burst of air. Sat down. My hands were shaking. “He did?”

“Yes, but Soraya jan is upstairs in her room. She wants to talk to you first.”

“Okay.”

Baba said something to someone and there was a double click as he hung up.

“Amir?” Soraya’s voice. “Salaam.”

“My father said yes.”

“I know,” I said. I switched hands. I was smiling. “I’m so happy I don’t know what to say.”

“I’m happy too, Amir. I... can’t believe this is happening.”

I laughed. “I know.”

“Listen,” she said, “I want to tell you something. Something you have to know before...”

“I don’t care what it is.”

“You need to know. I don’t want us to start with secrets. And I’d rather you hear it from me.”

“If it will make you feel better, tell me. But it won’t change anything.”

There was a long pause at the other end. “When we lived in Virginia, I ran away with an Afghan

man. I was eighteen at the time... rebellious... stupid, and... he was into drugs... We lived together for

almost a month. All the Afghans in Virginia were talking about it.

“Padar eventually found us. He showed up at the door and... made me come home. I was hysterical.

Yelling. Screaming. Saying I hated him...

“Anyway, I came home and--” She was crying. “Excuse me.” I heard her put the phone down. Blow

her nose. “Sorry,” she came back on, sounding hoarse. “When I came home, I saw my mother had

had a stroke, the right side of her face was paralyzed and... I felt so guilty. She didn’t deserve that.

“Padar moved us to California shortly after.” A silence followed.

“How are you and your father now?” I said.

“We’ve always had our differences, we still do, but I’m grateful he came for me that day. I really

believe he saved me.” She paused. “So, does what I told you bother you?”

“A little,” I said. I owed her the truth on this one. I couldn’t lie to her and say that my pride, my

iftikhar, wasn’t stung at all that she had been with a man, whereas I had never taken a woman to bed.

It did bother me a bit, but I had pondered this quite a lot in the weeks before I asked Baba to go

khastegari. And in the end the question that always came back to me was this: How could I, of all

people, chastise someone for their past?

“Does it bother you enough to change your mind?”

“No, Soraya. Not even close,” I said. “Nothing you said changes anything. I want us to marry.”

She broke into fresh tears.

I envied her. Her secret was out. Spoken. Dealt with. I opened my mouth and almost told her how

I’d betrayed Hassan, lied, driven him out, and destroyed a forty-year relationship between Baba and

Ali. But I didn’t. I suspected there were many ways in which Soraya Taheri was a better person than

me. Courage was just one of them.

THIRTEEN

When we arrived at the Taheris’ home the next evening--for lafz, the ceremony of “giving word”--I

had to park the Ford across the street. Their driveway was already jammed with cars. I wore a navy

blue suit I had bought the previous day, after I had brought Baba home from _khastegari_. I checked

my tie in the rearview mirror.

“You look khoshteep,” Baba said. Handsome.

“Thank you, Baba. Are you all right? Do you feel up to this?”

“Up to this? It’s the happiest day of my life, Amir,” he said, smiling tiredly.

I COULD HEAR CHATTER from the other side of the door, laughter, and Afghan music playing

softly--it sounded like a classical ghazal by Ustad Sarahang. I rang the bell. A face peeked through

the curtains of the foyer window and disappeared. “They’re here!” I heard a woman’s voice say. The

chatter stopped. Someone turned off the music.

Khanum Taheri opened the door. “_Salaam alaykum_,” she said, beaming. She’d permed her hair, I

saw, and wore an elegant, ankle-length black dress. When I stepped into the foyer, her eyes

moistened. “You’re barely in the house and I’m crying already, Amir jan,” she said. I planted a kiss

on her hand, just as Baba had instructed me to do the night before.

She led us through a brightly lit hallway to the living room. On the wood-paneled walls, I saw

pictures of the people who would become my new family: A young bouffant-haired Khanum Taheri

and the general--Niagara Falls in the background; Khanum Taheri in a seamless dress, the general in

a narrow-lapelled jacket and thin tie, his hair full and black; Soraya, about to board a wooden roller

coaster, waving and smiling, the sun glinting off the silver wires in her teeth. A photo of the general,

dashing in full military outfit, shaking hands with King Hussein of Jordan. A portrait of Zahir Shah.

The living room was packed with about two dozen guests seated on chairs placed along the walls.

When Baba entered, everybody stood up. We went around the room, Baba leading slowly, me behind

him, shaking hands and greeting the guests. The general--still in his gray suit--and Baba embraced,

gently tapping each other on the back. They said their Salaams in respectful hushed tones.

The general held me at arm’s length and smiled knowingly, as if saying, “Now, this is the right

way--the Afghan way--to do it, _bachem_.” We kissed three times on the cheek.

We sat in the crowded room, Baba and I next to each other, across from the general and his wife.

Baba’s breathing had grown a little ragged, and he kept wiping sweat off his forehead and scalp with

his handkerchief. He saw me looking at him and managed a strained grin. I’m all right,” he mouthed.

In keeping with tradition, Soraya was not present.

A few moments of small talk and idle chatter followed until the general cleared his throat. The room

became quiet and everyone looked down at their hands in respect. The general nodded toward Baba.

Baba cleared his own throat. When he began, he couldn’t speak in complete sentences without

stopping to breathe. “General Sahib, Khanum Jamila jan... it’s with great humility that my son and I...

have come to your home today. You are... honorable people... from distinguished and reputable

families and... proud lineage. I come with nothing but the utmost ihtiram... and the highest regards

for you, your family names, and the memory... of your ancestors.” He stopped. Caught his breath.

Wiped his brow. “Amirjan is my only son... my only child, and he has been a good son to me. I hope

he proves... worthy of your kindness. I ask that you honor Amir jan and me... and accept my son into

your family.”

The general nodded politely.

“We are honored to welcome the son of a man such as yourself into our family,” he said. “Your

reputation precedes you. I was your humble admirer in Kabul and remain so today. We are honored

that your family and ours will be joined.

“Amirjan, as for you, I welcome you to my home as a son, as the husband of my daughter who is

the noor of my eye. Your pain will be our pain, your joy our joy. I hope that you will come to see your

Khala Jamila and me as a second set of parents, and I pray for your and our lovely Soraya jan’s

happiness. You both have our blessings.”

Everyone applauded, and with that signal, heads turned toward the hallway. The moment I’d waited

for.

Soraya appeared at the end. Dressed in a stunning winecolored traditional Afghan dress with long

sleeves and gold trimmings. Baba’s hand took mine and tightened. Khanum Taheri burst into fresh

tears. Slowly, Soraya caine to us, tailed by a procession of young female relatives.

She kissed my father’s hands. Sat beside me at last, her eyes downcast.

The applause swelled.

ACCORDING TO TRADITION, Soraya’s family would have thrown the engagement party the

Shirini-khori---or “Eating of the Sweets” ceremony. Then an engagement period would have followed

which would have lasted a few months. Then the wedding, which would be paid for by Baba.

We all agreed that Soraya and I would forgo the Shirini-khori. Everyone knew the reason, so no one

had to actually say it: that Baba didn’t have months to live.

Soraya and I never went out alone together while preparations for the wedding proceeded--since

we weren’t married yet, hadn’t even had a Shirini-khori, it was considered improper. So I had to

make do with going over to the Taheris with Baba for dinner. Sit across from Soraya at the dinner

table. Imagine what it would be like to feel her head on my chest, smell her hair. Kiss her. Make love

to her.

Baba spent $35,000, nearly the balance of his life savings, on the awroussi, the wedding ceremony.

He rented a large Afghan banquet hail in Fremont--the man who owned it knew him from Kabul and

gave him a substantial discount. Baba paid for the ??chi las, our matching wedding bands, and for

the diamond ring I picked out. He bought my tuxedo, and my traditional green suit for the nika--the

swearing ceremony. For all the frenzied preparations that went into the wedding night--most of it,

blessedly, by Khanum Taheri and her friends-- I remember only a handful of moments from it.

I remember our nika. We were seated around a table, Soraya and I dressed in green--the color of

Islam, but also the color of spring and new beginnings. I wore a suit, Soraya (the only woman at the

table) a veiled long-sleeved dress. Baba, General Taheri (in a tuxedo this time), and several of

Soraya’s uncles were also present at the table. Soraya and I looked down, solemnly respectful,

casting only sideway glances at each other. The mullah questioned the witnesses and read from the

Koran. We said our oaths. Signed the certificates. One of Soraya’s uncles from Virginia, Sharif jan,

Khanum Taheri’s brother, stood up and cleared his throat. Soraya had told me that he had lived in

the U.S. for more than twenty years. He worked for the INS and had an American wife. He was also a

poet. A small man with a birdlike face and fluffy hair, he read a lengthy poem dedicated to Soraya,

jotted down on hotel stationery paper. “Wah wah, Sharifjan!” everyone exclaimed when he finished.

I remember walking toward the stage, now in my tuxedo, Soraya a veiled pan in white, our hands

locked. Baba hobbled next to me, the general and his wife beside their daughter. A procession of

uncles, aunts, and cousins followed as we made our way through the hail, parting a sea of

applauding guests, blinking at flashing cameras. One of Soraya’s cousins, Sharif jan’s son, held a

Koran over our heads as we inched along. The wedding song, ahesta boro, blared from the speakers,

the same song the Russian soldier at the Mahipar checkpoint had sung the night Baba and I left

Kabul:

Make morning into a key and throw it into the well,

Go slowly, my lovely moon, go slowly. Let the morning sun forget to rise in the east, Go slowly, my

lovely moon, go slowly.

I remember sitting on the sofa, set on the stage like a throne, Soraya’s hand in mine, as three

hundred or so faces looked on. We did Ayena Masshaf, where they gave us a mirror and threw a veil

over our heads, so we’d be alone to gaze at each other’s reflection. Looking at Soraya’s smiling

face in that mirror, in the momentary privacy of the veil, I whispered to her for the first time that I

loved her. A blush, red like henna, bloomed on her cheeks.

I picture colorful platters of chopan kabob, sholeh-goshti, and wild-orange rice. I see Baba between

us on the sofa, smiling. I remember sweat-drenched men dancing the traditional attan in a circle,

bouncing, spinning faster and faster with the feverish tempo of the tabla, until all but a few dropped

out of the ring with exhaustion. I remember wishing Rahim Khan were there.

And I remember wondering if Hassan too had married. And if so, whose face he had seen in the

mirror under the veil? Whose henna-painted hands had he held?

AROUND 2 A.M., the party moved from the banquet hall to Baba’s apartment. Tea flowed once

more and music played until the neighbors called the cops. Later that night, the sun less than an

hour from rising and the guests finally gone, Soraya and I lay together for the first time. All my life,

I’d been around men. That night, I discovered the tenderness of a woman.

IT WAS SORAYA who suggested that she move in with Baba and me.

“I thought you might want us to have our own place,” I said.

“With Kaka jan as sick as he is?” she replied. Her eyes told me that was no way to start a marriage.

I kissed her. “Thank you.”

Soraya dedicated herself to taking care of my father. She made his toast and tea in the morning,

and helped him in and out of bed. She gave him his pain pills, washed his clothes, read him the

international section of the newspaper every afternoon, She cooked his favorite dish, potato shorwa,

though he could scarcely eat more than a few spoonfuls, and took him out every day for a brief walk

around the block. And when he became bedridden, she turned him on his side every hour so he

wouldn’t get a bedsore.

One day, I came home from the pharmacy with Baba’s morphine pills. Just as I shut the door, I

caught a glimpse of Soraya quickly sliding something under Baba’s blanket. “Hey, I saw that! What

were you two doing?” I said.

“Nothing,” Soraya said, smiling.

“Liar.” I lifted Baba’s blanket. “What’s this?” I said, though as soon as I picked up the

leather-bound book, I knew. I traced my fingers along the gold-stitched borders. I remembered the

fire works the night Rahim Khan had given it to me, the night of my thirteenth birthday, flares sizzling

and exploding into bouquets of red, green, and yellow.

“I can’t believe you can write like this,” Soraya said.

Baba dragged his head off the pillow. “I put her up to it. I hope you don’t mind.”

I gave the notebook back to Soraya and left the room. Baba hated it when I cried.

A MONTH AFTER THE WEDDING, the Taheris, Sharif, his wife Suzy, and several of Soraya’s aunts

came over to our apartment for dinner. Soraya made sabzi challow--white rice with spinach and lamb.

After dinner, we all had green tea and played cards in groups of four. Soraya and I played with Sharif

and Suzy on the coffee table, next to the couch where Baba lay under a wool blanket. He watched me

joking with Sharif, watched Soraya and me lacing our fingers together, watched me push back a

loose curl of her hair. I could see his internal smile, as wide as the skies of Kabul on nights when the

poplars shivered and the sound of crickets swelled in the gardens.

Just before midnight, Baba asked us to help him into bed. Soraya and I placed his arms on our

shoulders and wrapped ours around his back. When we lowered him, he had Soraya turn off the

bedside lamp. He asked us to lean in, gave us each a kiss.

“I’ll come back with your morphine and a glass of water, Kaka jan,” Soraya said.

“Not tonight,” he said. “There is no pain tonight.”

“Okay,” she said. She pulled up his blanket. We closed the door. Baba never woke up.

THEY FILLED THE PARKING SPOTS at the mosque in Hayward. On the balding grass field behind

the building, cars and SUVs parked in crowded makeshift rows. People had to drive three or four

blocks north of the mosque to find a spot.

The men’s section of the mosque was a large square room, covered with Afghan rugs and thin

mattresses placed in parallel lines. Men filed into the room, leaving their shoes at the entrance, and

sat cross-legged on the mattresses. A mullah chanted surrahs from the Koran into a microphone. I

sat by the door, the customary position for the family of the deceased. General Taheri was seated

next to me.

Through the open door, I could see lines of cars pulling in, sunlight winking in their windshields.

They dropped off passengers, men dressed in dark suits, women clad in black dresses, their heads

covered with traditional white hijabs.

As words from the Koran reverberated through the room, I thought of the old story of Baba

wrestling a black bear in Baluchistan. Baba had wrestled bears his whole life. Losing his young wife.

Raising a son by himself. Leaving his beloved homeland, his watan. Poverty. Indignity. In the end, a

bear had come that he couldn’t best. But even then, he had lost on his own terms.

After each round of prayers, groups of mourners lined up and greeted me on their way out.

Dutifully, I shook their hands. Many of them I barely knew I smiled politely, thanked them for their

wishes, listened to whatever they had to say about Baba.

??helped me build the house in Taimani...“ bless him...

??no one else to turn to and he lent me...”

“...found me a job... barely knew me...”

“...like a brother to me...”

Listening to them, I realized how much of who I was, what I was, had been defined by Baba and the

marks he had left on people’s lives. My whole life, I had been “Baba’s son.” Now he was gone. Baba

couldn’t show me the way anymore; I’d have to find it on my own.

The thought of it terrified me.

Earlier, at the gravesite in the small Muslim section of the cemetery, I had watched them lower

Baba into the hole. The ??mul Iah and another man got into an argument over which was the correct

ayat of the Koran to recite at the gravesite. It might have turned ugly had General Taheri not

intervened. The mullah chose an ayat and recited it, casting the other fellow nasty glances. I watched

them toss the first shovelful of dirt into the grave. Then I left. Walked to the other side of the

cemetery. Sat in the shade of a red maple.

Now the last of the mourners had paid their respects and the mosque was empty, save for the

mullah unplugging the microphone and wrapping his Koran in green cloth. The general and I stepped

out into a late-afternoon sun. We walked down the steps, past men smoking in clusters. I heard

snippets of their conversations, a soccer game in Union City next weekend, a new Afghan restaurant

in Santa Clara. Life moving on already, leaving Baba behind.

“How are you, bachem?” General Taheri said.

I gritted my teeth. Bit back the tears that had threatened all day. “I’m going to find Soraya,” I said.

“Okay.”

I walked to the women’s side of the mosque. Soraya was standing on the steps with her mother

and a couple of ladies I recognized vaguely from the wedding. I motioned to Soraya. She said

something to her mother and came to me.

“Can we walk?” I said.

“Sure.” She took my hand.

We walked in silence down a winding gravel path lined by a row of low hedges. We sat on a bench

and watched an elderly couple kneeling beside a grave a few rows away and placing a bouquet of

daisies by the headstone. “Soraya?”

“Yes?”

“I’m going to miss him.”

She put her hand on my lap. Baba’s chila glinted on her ring finger. Behind her, I could see Baba’s

mourners driving away on Mission Boulevard. Soon we’d leave too, and for the first time ever, Baba

would be all alone.

Soraya pulled me to her and the tears finally came.

BECAUSE SORAYA AND I never had an engagement period, much of what I learned about the

Taheris I learned after I married into their family. For example, I learned that, once a month, the

general suffered from blinding migraines that lasted almost a week. When the headaches struck, the

general went to his room, undressed, turned off the light, locked the door, and didn’t come out until

the pain subsided. No one was allowed to go in, no one was allowed to knock. Eventually, he would

emerge, dressed in his gray suit once more, smelling of sleep and bedsheets, his eyes puffy and

bloodshot. I learned from Soraya that he and Khanum Taheri had slept in separate rooms for as long

as she could remember. I learned that he could be petty, such as when he’d take a bite of the

_qurma_ his wife placed before him, sigh, and push it away. “I’ll make you something else,” Khanum

Taheri would say, but he’d ignore her, sulk, and eat bread and onion. This made Soraya angry and

her mother cry. Soraya told me he took antide pressants. I learned that he had kept his family on

welfare and had never held a job in the U.S., preferring to cash government-issued checks than

degrading himself with work unsuitable for a man of his stature--he saw the flea market only as a

hobby, a way to socialize with his fellow Afghans. The general believed that, sooner or later,

Afghanistan would be freed, the monarchy restored, and his services would once again be called

upon. So every day, he donned his gray suit, wound his pocket watch, and waited.

I learned that Khanum Taheri--whom I called Khala Jamila now--had once been famous in Kabul for

her enchanting singing voice. Though she had never sung professionally, she had had the talent to--I

learned she could sing folk songs, ghazals, even raga, which was usually a man’s domain. But as

much as the general appreciated listening to music--he owned, in fact, a considerable collection of

classical ghazal tapes by Afghan and Hindi singers--he believed the performing of it best left to those

with lesser reputations. That she never sing in public had been one of the general’s conditions when

they had married. Soraya told me that her mother had wanted to sing at our wedding, only one song,

but the general gave her one of his looks and the matter was buried. Khala Jamila played the lotto

once a week and watched Johnny Carson every night. She spent her days in the garden, tending to

her roses, geraniums, potato vines, and orchids.

When I married Soraya, the flowers and Johnny Carson took a backseat. I was the new delight in

Khala Jamila’s life. Unlike the general’s guarded and diplomatic manners--he didn’t correct me

when I continued to call him “General Sahib”--Khala Jamila made no secret of how much she adored

me. For one thing, I listened to her impressive list of maladies, something the general had long

turned a deaf ear to. Soraya told me that, ever since her mother’s stroke, every flutter in her chest

was a heart attack, every aching joint the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, and every twitch of the eye

another stroke. I remember the first time Khala Jamila mentioned a lump in her neck to me. “I’ll skip

school tomorrow and take you to the doctor,” I said, to which the general smiled and said, “Then you

might as well turn in your books for good, bachem. Your khala’s medical charts are like the works of

Rumi: They come in volumes.”

But it wasn’t just that she’d found an audience for her monologues of illness. I firmly believed that

if I had picked up a rifle and gone on a murdering rampage, I would have still had the benefit of her

unblinking love. Because I had rid her heart of its gravest malady. I had relieved her of the greatest

fear of every Afghan mother: that no honorable khastegar would ask for her daughter’s hand. That

her daughter would age alone, husbandless, childless. Every woman needed a husband. Even if he

did silence the song in her.

And, from Soraya, I learned the details of what had happened in Virginia.

We were at a wedding. Soraya’s uncle, Sharif, the one who worked for the INS, was marrying his

son to an Afghan girl from Newark. The wedding was at the same hall where, six months prior,

Soraya and I had had our awroussi. We were standing in a crowd of guests, watching the bride

accept rings from the groom’s family, when we overheard two middle-aged women talking, their

backs to us.

“What a lovely bride,” one of them said, “Just look at her. So maghbool, like the moon.”

“Yes,” the other said. “And pure too. Virtuous. No boyfriends.”

“I know. I tell you that boy did well not to marry his cousin.”

Soraya broke down on the way home. I pulled the Ford off to the curb, parked under a streetlight on

Fremont Boulevard.

“It’s all right,” I said, pushing back her hair. “Who cares?”

“It’s so fucking unfair,” she barked.

“Just forget it.”

“Their sons go out to nightclubs looking for meat and get their girlfriends pregnant, they have kids

out of wedlock and no one says a goddamn thing. Oh, they’re just men having fun! I make one

mistake and suddenly everyone is talking nang and namoos, and I have to have my face rubbed in it

for the rest of my life.”

I wiped a tear from her jawline, just above her birthmark, with the pad of my thumb.

“I didn’t tell you,” Soraya said, dabbing at her eyes, “but my father showed up with a gun that

night. He told... him... that he had two bullets in the chamber, one for him and one for himself if I

didn’t come home. I was screaming, calling my father all kinds of names, saying he couldn’t keep

me locked up forever, that I wished he were dead.” Fresh tears squeezed out between her lids. “I

actually said that to him, that I wished he were dead.

“When he brought me home, my mother threw her arms around me and she was crying too. She

was saying things but I couldn’t understand any of it because she was slurring her words so badly.

So my father took me up to my bedroom and sat me in front of the dresser mirror. He handed me a

pair of scissors and calmly told me to cut off all my hair. He watched while I did it.

“I didn’t step out of the house for weeks. And when I did, I heard whispers or imagined them

everywhere I went. That was four years ago and three thousand miles away and I’m still hearing

them.”

“Fuck ‘em,” I said.

She made a sound that was half sob, half laugh. “When I told you about this on the phone the night

of khastegari, I was sure you’d change your mind.”

“No chance of that, Soraya.”

She smiled and took my hand. “I’m so lucky to have found you. You’re so different from every

Afghan guy I’ve met.”

“Let’s never talk about this again, okay?”

“Okay.”

I kissed her cheek and pulled away from the curb. As I drove, I wondered why I was different.

Maybe it was because I had been raised by men; I hadn’t grown up around women and had never

been exposed firsthand to the double standard with which Afghan society sometimes treated them.

Maybe it was because Baba had been such an unusual Afghan father, a liberal who had lived by his

own rules, a maverick who had disregarded or embraced societal customs as he had seen fit.

But I think a big part of the reason I didn’t care about Soraya’s past was that I had one of my own. I

knew all about regret.

SHORTLY AFTER BABA’S DEATH, Soraya and I moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Fremont,

just a few blocks away from the general and Khala Jamila’s house. Soraya’s parents bought us a

brown leather couch and a set of Mikasa dishes as housewarming presents. The general gave me an

additional present, a brand new IBM typewriter. In the box, he had slipped a note written in Farsi:

Amir jan,

I hope you discover many tales on these keys.

General Iqbal Taheri

I sold Baba’s VW bus and, to this day, I have not gone back to the flea market. I would drive to his

gravesite every Friday, and, sometimes, I’d find a fresh bouquet of freesias by the headstone and

know Soraya had been there too.

Soraya and I settled into the routines--and minor wonders-- of married life. We shared toothbrushes

and socks, passed each other the morning paper. She slept on the right side of the bed, I preferred

the left. She liked fluffy pillows, I liked the hard ones. She ate her cereal dry, like a snack, and chased

it with milk.

I got my acceptance at San Jose State that summer and declared an English major. I took on a

security job, swing shift at a furniture warehouse in Sunnyvale. The job was dreadfully boring, but its

saving grace was a considerable one: When everyone left at 6 P.M. and shadows began to crawl

between aisles of plastic-covered sofas piled to the ceiling, I took out my books and studied. It was

in the Pine-Sol-scented office of that furniture warehouse that I began my first novel.

Soraya joined me at San Jose State the following year and enrolled, to her father’s chagrin, in the

teaching track.

“I don’t know why you’re wasting your talents like this,” the general said one night over dinner.

“Did you know, Amir jan, that she earned nothing but A’s in high school?” He turned to her. “An

intelligent girl like you could become a lawyer, a political scientist. And, _Inshallah_, when

Afghanistan is free, you could help write the new constitution. There would be a need for young

talented Afghans like you. They might even offer you a ministry position, given your family name.”

I could see Soraya holding back, her face tightening. “I’m not a girl, Padar. I’m a married woman.

Besides, they’d need teachers too.”

“Anyone can teach.”

“Is there any more rice, Madar?” Soraya said.

After the general excused himself to meet some friends in Hayward, Khala Jamila tried to console

Soraya. “He means well,” she said. “He just wants you to be successful.”

“So he can boast about his attorney daughter to his friends. Another medal for the general,”

Soraya said.

“Such nonsense you speak!”

“Successful,” Soraya hissed. “At least I’m not like him, sitting around while other people fight the

Shorawi, waiting for when the dust settles so he can move in and reclaim his posh little government

position. Teaching may not pay much, but it’s what I want to do! It’s what I love, and it’s a whole lot

better than collecting welfare, by the way.”

Khala Jamila bit her tongue. “If he ever hears you saying that, he will never speak to you again.”

“Don’t worry,” Soraya snapped, tossing her napkin on the plate. “I won’t bruise his precious ego.”

IN THE SUMMER of 1988, about six months before the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, I

finished my first novel, a father-son story set in Kabul, written mostly with the typewriter the general

had given me. I sent query letters to a dozen agencies and was stunned one August day when I

opened our mailbox and found a request from a New York agency for the completed manuscript. I

mailed it the next day. Soraya kissed the carefully wrapped manuscript and Khala Jamila insisted we

pass it under the Koran. She told me that she was going to do nazr for me, a vow to have a sheep

slaughtered and the meat given to the poor if my book was accepted.

“Please, no nazn, Khala jan,” I said, kissing her face. “Just do _zakat_, give the money to someone

in need, okay? No sheep killing.”

Six weeks later, a man named Martin Greenwalt called from New York and offered to represent me. I

only told Soraya about it. “But just because I have an agent doesn’t mean I’ll get published. If Martin

sells the novel, then we’ll celebrate.”

A month later, Martin called and informed me I was going to be a published novelist. When I told

Soraya, she screamed.

We had a celebration dinner with Soraya’s parents that night. Khala Jamila made kofta--meatballs

and white rice--and white ferni. The general, a sheen of moisture in his eyes, said that he was proud

of me. After General Taheri and his wife left, Soraya and I celebrated with an expensive bottle of

Merlot I had bought on the way home--the general did not approve of women drinking alcohol, and

Soraya didn’t drink in his presence.

“I am so proud of you,” she said, raising her glass to mine. “Kaka would have been proud too.”

“I know,” I said, thinking of Baba, wishing he could have seen me.

Later that night, after Soraya fell asleep--wine always made her sleepy--I stood on the balcony and

breathed in the cool summer air. I thought of Rahim Khan and the little note of support he had written

me after he’d read my first story. And I thought of Hassan. Some day, _Inshallah_, you will be a great

writer, he had said once, and people all over the world will read your stories. There was so much

goodness in my life. So much happiness. I wondered whether I deserved any of it.

The novel was released in the summer of that following year, 1989, and the publisher sent me on a

five-city book tour. I became a minor celebrity in the Afghan community. That was the year that the

Shorawi completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan. It should have been a time of glory for

Afghans. Instead, the war raged on, this time between Afghans, the Mujahedin, against the Soviet

puppet government of Najibullah, and Afghan refugees kept flocking to Pakistan. That was the year

that the cold war ended, the year the Berlin Wall came down. It was the year of Tiananmen Square. In

the midst of it all, Afghanistan was forgotten. And General Taheri, whose hopes had stirred awake

after the Soviets pulled out, went back to winding his pocket watch.

That was also the year that Soraya and I began trying to have a child.

THE IDEA OF FATHERHOOD unleashed a swirl of emotions in me. I found it frightening,

invigorating, daunting, and exhilarating all at the same time. What sort of father would I make, I

wondered. I wanted to be just like Baba and I wanted to be nothing like him.

But a year passed and nothing happened. With each cycle of blood, Soraya grew more frustrated,

more impatient, more irritable. By then, Khala Jamila’s initially subtle hints had become overt, as in

“Kho dega!” So! “When am I going to sing alahoo for my little nawasa?” The general, ever the

Pashtun, never made any queries--doing so meant alluding to a sexual act between his daughter and

a man, even if the man in question had been married to her for over four years. But his eyes perked

up when Khala Jamila teased us about a baby.

“Sometimes, it takes a while,” I told Soraya one night.

“A year isn’t a while, Amir!” she said, in a terse voice so unlike her. “Something’s wrong, I know

it.”

“Then let’s see a doctor.”

DR. ROSEN, a round-bellied man with a plump face and small, even teeth, spoke with a faint

Eastern European accent, some thing remotely Slavic. He had a passion for trains--his office was

littered with books about the history of railroads, model locomotives, paintings of trains trundling on

tracks through green hills and over bridges. A sign above his desk read, LIFE IS A TRAIN. GET ON

BOARD.

He laid out the plan for us. I’d get checked first. “Men are easy,” he said, fingers tapping on his

mahogany desk. “A man’s plumbing is like his mind: simple, very few surprises. You ladies, on the

other hand... well, God put a lot of thought into making you.” I wondered if he fed that bit about the

plumbing to all of his couples.

“Lucky us,” Soraya said.

Dr. Rosen laughed. It fell a few notches short of genuine. He gave me a lab slip and a plastic jar,

handed Soraya a request for some routine blood tests. We shook hands. “Welcome aboard,” he said,

as he showed us out.

I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS.

The next few months were a blur of tests on Soraya: Basal body temperatures, blood tests for

every conceivable hormone, urine tests, something called a “Cervical Mucus Test,” ultrasounds,

more blood tests, and more urine tests. Soraya underwent a procedure called a hysteroscopy--Dr.

Rosen inserted a telescope into Soraya’s uterus and took a look around. He found nothing. “The

plumbing’s clear,” he announced, snapping off his latex gloves. I wished he’d stop calling it that--we

weren’t bathrooms. When the tests were over, he explained that he couldn’t explain why we

couldn’t have kids. And, apparently, that wasn’t so unusual. It was called “Unexplained Infertility.”

Then came the treatment phase. We tried a drug called Clomiphene, and hMG, a series of shots

which Soraya gave to herself. When these failed, Dr. Rosen advised in vitro fertilization. We received

a polite letter from our HMO, wishing us the best of luck, regretting they couldn’t cover the cost.

We used the advance I had received for my novel to pay for it. IVF proved lengthy, meticulous,

frustrating, and ultimately unsuccessful. After months of sitting in waiting rooms reading magazines

like Good Housekeeping and Reader’s Digest, after endless paper gowns and cold, sterile exam

rooms lit by fluorescent lights, the repeated humiliation of discussing every detail of our sex life with

a total stranger, the injections and probes and specimen collections, we went back to Dr. Rosen and

his trains.

He sat across from us, tapped his desk with his fingers, and used the word “adoption” for the first

time. Soraya cried all the way home.

Soraya broke the news to her parents the weekend after our last visit with Dr. Rosen. We were

sitting on picnic chairs in the Taheris’ backyard, grilling trout and sipping yogurt dogh. It was an

early evening in March 1991. Khala Jamila had watered the roses and her new honeysuckles, and

their fragrance mixed with the smell of cooking fish. Twice already, she had reached across her chair

to caress Soraya’s hair and say, “God knows best, bachem. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be.”

Soraya kept looking down at her hands. She was tired, I knew, tired of it all. “The doctor said we

could adopt,” she murmured.

General Taheri’s head snapped up at this. He closed the barbecue lid. “He did?”

“He said it was an option,” Soraya said.

We’d talked at home about adoption. Soraya was ambivalent at best. “I know it’s silly and maybe

vain,” she said to me on the way to her parents’ house, “but I can’t help it. I’ve always dreamed that

I’d hold it in my arms and know my blood had fed it for nine months, that I’d look in its eyes one day

and be startled to see you or me, that the baby would grow up and have your smile or mine. Without

that... Is that wrong?”

“No,” I had said.

“Am I being selfish?”

“No, Soraya.”

“Because if you really want to do it...”

“No,” I said. “If we’re going to do it, we shouldn’t have any doubts at all about it, and we should

both be in agreement. It wouldn’t be fair to the baby otherwise.”

She rested her head on the window and said nothing else the rest of the way.

Now the general sat beside her. “Bachem, this adoption... thing, I’m not so sure it’s for us

Afghans.” Soraya looked at me tiredly and sighed.

“For one thing, they grow up and want to know who their natural parents are,” he said. “Nor can

you blame them. Sometimes, they leave the home in which you labored for years to provide for them

so they can find the people who gave them life. Blood is a powerful thing, bachem, never forget that.”

“I don’t want to talk about this anymore,” Soraya said.

“I’ll say one more thing,” he said. I could tell he was getting revved up; we were about to get one of

the general’s little speeches. “Take Amir jan, here. We all knew his father, I know who his

grandfather was in Kabul and his great-grandfather before him, I could sit here and trace generations

of his ancestors for you if you asked. That’s why when his father--God give him peace--came

khastegari, I didn’t hesitate. And believe me, his father wouldn’t have agreed to ask for your hand if

he didn’t know whose descendant you were. Blood is a powerful thing, bachem, and when you

adopt, you don’t know whose blood you’re bringing into your house.

“Now, if you were American, it wouldn’t matter. People here marry for love, family name and

ancestry never even come into the equation. They adopt that way too, as long as the baby is healthy,

everyone is happy. But we are Afghans, bachem.”

“Is the fish almost ready?” Soraya said. General Taheri’s eyes lingered on her. He patted her knee.

“Just be happy you have your health and a good husband.”

“What do you think, Amir jan?” Khala Jamila said.

I put my glass on the ledge, where a row of her potted geraniums were dripping water. “I think I

agree with General Sahib.”

Reassured, the general nodded and went back to the grill.

We all had our reasons for not adopting. Soraya had hers, the general his, and I had this: that

perhaps something, someone, somewhere, had decided to deny me fatherhood for the things I had

done. Maybe this was my punishment, and perhaps justly so. It wasn’t meant to be, Khala Jamila had

said. Or, maybe, it was meant not to be.

A FEW MONTHS LATER, we used the advance for my second novel and placed a down payment on

a pretty, two-bedroom Victorian house in San Francisco’s Bernal Heights. It had a peaked roof,

hardwood floors, and a tiny backyard which ended in a sun deck and a fire pit. The general helped

me refinish the deck and paint the walls. Khala Jamila bemoaned us moving almost an hour away,

especially since she thought Soraya needed all the love and support she could get--oblivious to the

fact that her well-intended but overbearing sympathy was precisely what was driving Soraya to

move.

SOMETIMES, SORAYA SLEEPING NEXT TO ME, I lay in bed and listened to the screen door

swinging open and shut with the breeze, to the crickets chirping in the yard. And I could almost feel

the emptiness in Soraya’s womb, like it was a living, breathing thing. It had seeped into our

marriage, that emptiness, into our laughs, and our lovemaking. And late at night, in the darkness of

our room, I’d feel it rising from Soraya and settling between us. Sleeping between us. Like a

newborn child.

FOURTEEN

_June 2001_

I lowered the phone into the cradle and stared at it for a long time. It wasn’t until Aflatoon startled

me with a bark that I realized how quiet the room had become. Soraya had muted the television.

“You look pale, Amir,” she said from the couch, the same one her parents had given us as a

housewarming gift for our first apartment. She’d been tying on it with Aflatoon’s head nestled on

her chest, her legs buried under the worn pillows. She was halfwatching a PBS special on the plight

of wolves in Minnesota, half-correcting essays from her summer-school class--she’d been teaching

at the same school now for six years. She sat up, and Aflatoon leapt down from the couch. It was the

general who had given our cocker spaniel his name, Farsi for “Plato,” because, he said, if you looked

hard enough and long enough into the dog’s filmy black eyes, you’d swear he was thinking wise

thoughts.

There was a sliver of fat, just a hint of it, beneath Soraya’s chin now The past ten years had padded

the curves of her hips some, and combed into her coal black hair a few streaks of cinder gray. But

she still had the face of a Grand Ball princess, with her bird-in-flight eyebrows and nose, elegantly

curved like a letter from ancient Arabic writings.

“You took pale,” Soraya repeated, placing the stack of papers on the table.

“I have to go to Pakistan.”

She stood up now. “Pakistan?”

“Rahim Khan is very sick.” A fist clenched inside me with those words.

“Kaka’s old business partner?” She’d never met Rahim Khan, but I had told her about him. I

nodded.

“Oh,” she said. “I’m so sorry, Amir.”

“We used to be close,” I said. “When I was a kid, he was the first grown-up I ever thought of as a

friend.” I pictured him and Baba drinking tea in Baba’s study, then smoking near the window, a

sweetbrier-scented breeze blowing from the garden and bending the twin columns of smoke.

“I remember you telling me that,” Soraya said. She paused. “How long will you be gone?”

“I don’t know. He wants to see me.”

“Is it...”

“Yes, it’s safe. I’ll be all right, Soraya.” It was the question she’d wanted to ask all along--fifteen

years of marriage had turned us into mind readers. “I’m going to go for a walk.”

“Should I go with you?”

“Nay, I’d rather be alone.”

I DROVE TO GOLDEN GATE PARK and walked along Spreckels Lake on the northern edge of the

park. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon; the sun sparkled on the water where dozens of miniature

boats sailed, propelled by a crisp San Francisco breeze. I sat on a park bench, watched a man toss a

football to his son, telling him to not sidearm the ball, to throw over the shoulder. I glanced up and

saw a pair of kites, red with long blue tails. They floated high above the trees on the west end of the

park, over the windmills.

I thought about a comment Rahim Khan had made just before we hung up. Made it in passing,

almost as an afterthought. I closed my eyes and saw him at the other end of the scratchy

longdistance line, saw him with his lips slightly parted, head tilted to one side. And again, something

in his bottomless black eyes hinted at an unspoken secret between us. Except now I knew he knew.

My suspicions had been right all those years. He knew about Assef, the kite, the money, the watch

with the lightning bolt hands. He had always known.

Come. There is a way to be good again, Rahim Khan had said on the phone just before hanging up.

Said it in passing, almost as an afterthought.

A way to be good again.

WHEN I CAME HOME, Soraya was on the phone with her mother. “Won’t be long, Madarjan. A

week, maybe two... Yes, you and Padar can stay with me.”

Two years earlier, the general had broken his right hip. He’d had one of his migraines again, and

emerging from his room, bleary-eyed and dazed, he had tripped on a loose carpet edge. His scream

had brought Khala Jamila running from the kitchen. “It sounded like a jaroo, a broomstick, snapping

in half,” she was always fond of saying, though the doctor had said it was unlikely she’d heard

anything of the sort. The general’s shattered hip--and all of the ensuing complications, the

pneumonia, blood poisoning, the protracted stay at the nursing home--ended Khala Jamila’s

long-running soliloquies about her own health. And started new ones about the general’s. She’d tell

anyone who would listen that the doctors had told them his kidneys were failing. “But then they had

never seen Afghan kidneys, had they?” she’d say proudly. What I remember most about the

general’s hospital stay is how Khala Jamila would wait until he fell asleep, and then sing to him,

songs I remembered from Kabul, playing on Baba’s scratchy old transistor radio.

The general’s frailty--and time--had softened things between him and Soraya too. They took walks

together, went to lunch on Saturdays, and, sometimes, the general sat in on some of her classes.

He’d sit in the back of the room, dressed in his shiny old gray suit, wooden cane across his lap,

smiling. Sometimes he even took notes.

THAT NIGHT, Soraya and I lay in bed, her back pressed to my chest, my face buried in her hair. I

remembered when we used to lay forehead to forehead, sharing afterglow kisses and whispering

until our eyes drifted closed, whispering about tiny, curled toes, first smiles, first words, first steps.

We still did sometimes, but the whispers were about school, my new book, a giggle over someone’s

ridiculous dress at a party. Our lovemaking was still good, at times better than good, but some

nights all I’d feel was a relief to be done with it, to be free to drift away and forget, at least for a while,

about the futility of what we’d just done. She never said so, but I knew sometimes Soraya felt it too.

On those nights, we’d each roll to our side of the bed and let our own savior take us away. Soraya’s

was sleep. Mine, as always, was a book.

I lay in the dark the night Rahim Khan called and traced with my eyes the parallel silver lines on the

wall made by moonlight pouring through the blinds. At some point, maybe just before dawn, I drifted

to sleep. And dreamed of Hassan running in the snow, the hem of his green chapan dragging behind

him, snow crunching under his black rubber boots. He was yelling over his shoulder: For you, a

thousand times over!

A WEEK LATER, I sat on a window seat aboard a Pakistani International Airlines flight, watching a

pair of uniformed airline workers remove the wheel chocks. The plane taxied out of the terminal and,

soon, we were airborne, cutting through the clouds. I rested my head against the window. Waited, in

vain, for sleep.

FIFTEEN

Three hours after my flight landed in Peshawar, I was sitting on shredded upholstery in the

backseat of a smoke-filled taxicab. My driver, a chain-smoking, sweaty little man who introduced

himself as Gholam, drove nonchalantly and recklessly, averting collisions by the thinnest of margins,

all without so much as a pause in the incessant stream of words spewing from his mouth:

??terrible what is happening in your country, yar. Afghani people and Pakistani people they are like

brothers, I tell you. Muslims have to help Muslims so...”

I tuned him out, switched to a polite nodding mode. I remembered Peshawar pretty well from the

few months Baba and I had spent there in 1981. We were heading west now on Jamrud road, past the

Cantonment and its lavish, high-walled homes. The bustle of the city blurring past me reminded me

of a busier, more crowded version of the Kabul I knew, particularly of the KochehMorgha, or Chicken

Bazaar, where Hassan and I used to buy chutney-dipped potatoes and cherry water. The streets were

clogged with bicycle riders, milling pedestrians, and rickshaws popping blue smoke, all weaving

through a maze of narrow lanes and alleys. Bearded vendors draped in thin blankets sold animalskin

lampshades, carpets, embroidered shawls, and copper goods from rows of small, tightly jammed

stalls. The city was bursting with sounds; the shouts of vendors rang in my ears mingled with the

blare of Hindi music, the sputtering of rickshaws, and the jingling bells of horse-drawn carts. Rich

scents, both pleasant and not so pleasant, drifted to me through the passenger window, the spicy

aroma of pakora and the nihari Baba had loved so much blended with the sting of diesel fumes, the

stench of rot, garbage, and feces.

A little past the redbrick buildings of Peshawar University, we entered an area my garrulous driver

referred to as “Afghan Town.” I saw sweetshops and carpet vendors, kabob stalls, kids with

dirtcaked hands selling cigarettes, tiny restaurants--maps of Afghanistan painted on their

windows--all interlaced with backstreet aid agencies. “Many of your brothers in this area, yar. They

are opening businesses, but most of them are very poor.” He tsk’ed his tongue and sighed.

“Anyway, we’re getting close now.”

I thought about the last time I had seen Rahim Khan, in 1981. He had come to say good-bye the

night Baba and I had fled Kabul. I remember Baba and him embracing in the foyer, crying softly.

When Baba and I arrived in the U.S., he and Rahim Khan kept in touch. They would speak four or five

times a year and, sometimes, Baba would pass me the receiver. The last time I had spoken to Rahim

Khan had been shortly after Baba’s death. The news had reached Kabul and he had called. We’d

only spoken for a few minutes and lost the connection.

The driver pulled up to a narrow building at a busy corner where two winding streets intersected. I

paid the driver, took my lone suitcase, and walked up to the intricately carved door. The building had

wooden balconies with open shutters--from many of them, laundry was hanging to dry in the sun. I

walked up the creaky stairs to the second floor, down a dim hallway to the last door on the right.

Checked the address on the piece of stationery paper in my palm. Knocked.

Then, a thing made of skin and bones pretending to be Rahim Khan opened the door.

A CREATIVE WRITING TEACHER at San Jose State used to say about clichés: “Avoid them like the

plague.” Then he’d laugh at his own joke. The class laughed along with him, but I always thought

clichés got a bum rap. Because, often, they’re dead-on. But the aptness of the clichéd saying is

overshadowed by the nature of the saying as a cliché. For example, the “elephant in the room”

saying. Nothing could more correctly describe the initial moments of my reunion with Rahim Khan.

We sat on a wispy mattress set along the wall, across the window overlooking the noisy street

below. Sunlight slanted in and cast a triangular wedge of light onto the Afghan rug on the floor. Two

folding chairs rested against one wall and a small copper samovar sat in the opposite corner. I

poured us tea from it.

“How did you find me?” I asked.

“It’s not difficult to find people in America. I bought a map of the U.S., and called up information for

cities in Northern California,” he said. “It’s wonderfully strange to see you as a grown man.”

I smiled and dropped three sugar cubes in my tea. He liked his black and bitter, I remembered.

“Baba didn’t get the chance to tell you but I got married fifteen years ago.” The truth was, by then,

the cancer in Baba’s brain had made him forgetful, negligent.

“You are married? To whom?”

“Her name is Soraya Taheri.” I thought of her back home, worrying about me. I was glad she

wasn’t alone.

“Taheri... whose daughter is she?”

I told him. His eyes brightened. “Oh, yes, I remember now. Isn’t General Taheri married to Sharif

jan’s sister? What was her name...”

“Jamila jan.”

“Balay!” he said, smiling. “I knew Sharif jan in Kabul, long time ago, before he moved to America.”

“He’s been working for the INS for years, handles a lot of Afghan cases.”

“Haiiii,” he sighed. “Do you and Soraya jan have children?”

“Nay.”

“Oh.” He slurped his tea and didn’t ask more; Rahim Khan had always been one of the most

instinctive people I’d ever met.

I told him a lot about Baba, his job, the flea market, and how, at the end, he’d died happy. I told him

about my schooling, my books--four published novels to my credit now. He smiled at this, said he

had never had any doubt. I told him I had written short stories in the leather-bound notebook he’d

given me, but he didn’t remember the notebook.

The conversation inevitably turned to the Taliban.

“Is it as bad as I hear?” I said.

“Nay, it’s worse. Much worse,” he said. “They don’t let you be human.” He pointed to a scar above

his right eye cutting a crooked path through his bushy eyebrow. “I was at a soccer game in Ghazi

Stadium in 1998. Kabul against Mazar-i-Sharif, I think, and by the way the players weren’t allowed to

wear shorts. Indecent exposure, I guess.” He gave a tired laugh. “Anyway, Kabul scored a goal and

the man next to me cheered loudly. Suddenly this young bearded fellow who was patrolling the

aisles, eighteen years old at most by the look of him, he walked up to me and struck me on the

forehead with the butt of his Kalashnikov. ‘Do that again and I’ll cut out your tongue, you old

donkey!’ he said.” Rahim Khan rubbed the scar with a gnarled finger. “I was old enough to be his

grandfather and I was sitting there, blood gushing down my face, apologizing to that son of a dog.”

I poured him more tea. Rahim Khan talked some more. Much of it I knew already, some not. He told

me that, as arranged between Baba and him, he had lived in Baba’s house since 1981--this I knew

about. Baba had “sold” the house to Rahim Khan shortly before he and I fled Kabul. The way Baba

had seen it those days, Afghanistan’s troubles were only a temporary interruption of our way of

life--the days of parties at the Wazir Akbar Khan house and picnics in Paghman would surely return.

So he’d given the house to Rahim Khan to keep watch over until that day.

Rahim Khan told me how, when the Northern Alliance took over Kabul between 1992 and 1996,

different factions claimed different parts of Kabul. “If you went from the Shar-e-Nau section to

Kerteh-Parwan to buy a carpet, you risked getting shot by a sniper or getting blown up by a rocket--if

you got past all the checkpoints, that was. You practically needed a visa to go from one

neighborhood to the other. So people just stayed put, prayed the next rocket wouldn’t hit their

home.” He told me how people knocked holes in the walls of their homes so they could bypass the

dangerous streets and would move down the block from hole to hole. In other parts, people moved

about in underground tunnels.

“Why didn’t you leave?” I said.

“Kabul was my home. It still is.” He snickered. “Remember the street that went from your house to

the Qishla, the military bar racks next to Istiqial School?”

“Yes.” It was the shortcut to school. I remembered the day Hassan and I crossed it and the soldiers

had teased Hassan about his mother. Hassan had cried in the cinema later, and I’d put an arm

around him.

“When the Taliban rolled in and kicked the Alliance out of Kabul, I actually danced on that street,”

Rahim Khan said. “And, believe me, I wasn’t alone. People were celebrating at _Chaman_, at

Deh-Mazang, greeting the Taliban in the streets, climbing their tanks and posing for pictures with

them. People were so tired of the constant fighting, tired of the rockets, the gunfire, the explosions,

tired of watching Gulbuddin and his cohorts firing on any thing that moved. The Alliance did more

damage to Kabul than the Shorawi. They destroyed your father’s orphanage, did you know that?”

“Why?” I said. “Why would they destroy an orphanage?” I remembered sitting behind Baba the day

they opened the orphanage. The wind had knocked off his caracul hat and everyone had laughed,

then stood and clapped when he’d delivered his speech. And now it was just another pile of rubble.

All the money Baba had spent, all those nights he’d sweated over the blueprints, all the visits to the

construction site to make sure every brick, every beam, and every block was laid just right...

“Collateral damage,” Rahim Khan said. “You don’t want to know, Amir jan, what it was like sifting

through the rubble of that orphanage. There were body parts of children...”

“So when the Taliban came...”

“They were heroes,” Rahim Khan said. “Peace at last.”

“Yes, hope is a strange thing. Peace at last. But at what price?” A violent coughing fit gripped

Rahim Khan and rocked his gaunt body back and forth. When he spat into his handkerchief, it

immediately stained red. I thought that was as good a time as any to address the elephant sweating

with us in the tiny room.

“How are you?” I asked. “I mean really, how are you?”

“Dying, actually,” he said in a gurgling voice. Another round of coughing. More blood on the

handkerchief. He wiped his mouth, blotted his sweaty brow from one wasted temple to the other with

his sleeve, and gave me a quick glance. When he nodded, I knew he had read the next question on

my face. “Not long,” he breathed.

“How long?”

He shrugged. Coughed again. “I don’t think I’ll see the end of this summer,” he said.

“Let me take you home with me. I can find you a good doctor. They’re coming up with new

treatments all the time. There are new drugs and experimental treatments, we could enroll you in

one...” I was rambling and I knew it. But it was better than crying, which I was probably going to do

anyway.

He let out a chuff of laughter, revealed missing lower incisors. It was the most tired laughter I’d

ever heard. “I see America has infused you with the optimism that has made her so great. That’s

very good. We’re a melancholic people, we Afghans, aren’t we? Often, we wallow too much in

ghamkhori and self-pity. We give in to loss, to suffering, accept it as a fact of life, even see it as

necessary. Zendagi migzara, we say, life goes on. But I am not surrendering to fate here, I am being

pragmatic. I have seen several good doctors here and they have given the same answer. I trust them

and believe them. There is such a thing as God’s will.”

“There is only what you do and what you don’t do,” I said.

Rahim Khan laughed. “You sounded like your father just now. I miss him so much. But it is God’s

will, Amir jan. It really is.” He paused. “Besides, there’s another reason I asked you to come here. I

wanted to see you before I go, yes, but something else too.”

“Anything.”

“You know all those years I lived in your father’s house after you left?”

“Yes.”

“I wasn’t alone for all of them. Hassan lived there with me.”

“Hassan,” I said. When was the last time I had spoken his name? Those thorny old barbs of guilt

bore into me once more, as if speaking his name had broken a spell, set them free to torment me

anew. Suddenly the air in Rahim Khan’s little flat was too thick, too hot, too rich with the smell of the

street.

“I thought about writing you and telling you before, but I wasn’t sure you wanted to know. Was I

wrong?”

The truth was no. The lie was yes. I settled for something in between. “I don’t know.”

He coughed another patch of blood into the handkerchief. When he bent his head to spit, I saw

honey-crusted sores on his scalp. “I brought you here because I am going to ask something of you.

I’m going to ask you to do something for me. But before I do, I want to tell you about Hassan. Do you

understand?”

“Yes,” I murmured.

“I want to tell you about him. I want to tell you everything. You will listen?”

I nodded.

Then Rahim Khan sipped some more tea. Rested his head against the wall and spoke.

SIXTEEN

There were a lot of reasons why I went to Hazarajat to find Hassan in 1986. The biggest one, Allah

forgive me, was that I was lonely. By then, most of my friends and relatives had either been killed or

had escaped the country to Pakistan or Iran. I barely knew anyone in Kabul anymore, the city where I

had lived my entire life. Everybody had fled. I would take a walk in the Karteh Parwan section--where

the melon vendors used to hang out in the old days, you remember that spot?--and I wouldn’t

recognize anyone there. No one to greet, no one to sit down with for chai, no one to share stories

with, just Roussi soldiers patrolling the streets. So eventually, I stopped going out to the city. I would

spend my days in your father’s house, up in the study, reading your mother’s old books, listening to

the news, watching the communist propaganda on television. Then I would pray natnaz, cook

something, eat, read some more, pray again, and go to bed. I would rise in the morning, pray, do it all

over again.

And with my arthritis, it was getting harder for me to maintain the house. My knees and back were

always aching--I would get up in the morning and it would take me at least an hour to shake the

stiffness from my joints, especially in the wintertime. I did not want to let your father’s house go to

rot; we had all had many good times in that house, so many memories, Amir jan. It was not

right--your father had designed that house himself; it had meant so much to him, and besides, I had

promised him I would care for it when he and you left for Pakistan. Now it was just me and the house

and... I did my best. I tried to water the trees every few days, cut the lawn, tend to the flowers, fix

things that needed fixing, but, even then, I was not a young man anymore.

But even so, I might have been able to manage. At least for a while longer. But when news of your

father’s death reached me... for the first time, I felt a terrible loneliness in that house. An unbearable

emptiness.

So one day, I fueled up the Buick and drove up to Hazarajat. I remembered that, after Ali dismissed

himself from the house, your father told me he and Hassan had moved to a small village just outside

Bamiyan. Ali had a cousin there as I recalled. I had no idea if Hassan would still be there, if anyone

would even know of him or his whereabouts. After all, it had been ten years since Ali and Hassan had

left your father’s house. Hassan would have been a grown man in 1986, twenty-two, twenty-three

years old. If he was even alive, that is--the Shorawi, may they rot in hell for what they did to our

watan, killed so many of our young men. I don’t have to tell you that.

But, with the grace of God, I found him there. It took very little searching--all I had to do was ask a

few questions in Bamiyan and people pointed me to his village. I do not even recall its name, or

whether it even had one. But I remember it was a scorching summer day and I was driving up a

rutted dirt road, nothing on either side but sunbaked bushes, gnarled, spiny tree trunks, and dried

grass like pale straw. I passed a dead donkey rotting on the side of the road. And then I turned a

corner and, right in the middle of that barren land, I saw a cluster of mud houses, beyond them

nothing but broad sky and mountains like jagged teeth.

The people in Bamiyan had told me I would find him easily--he lived in the only house in the village

that had a walled garden. The mud wall, short and pocked with holes, enclosed the tiny house--which

was really not much more than a glorified hut. Barefoot children were playing on the street, kicking a

ragged tennis ball with a stick, and they stared when I pulled up and killed the engine. I knocked on

the wooden door and stepped through into a yard that had very little in it save for a parched

strawberry patch and a bare lemon tree. There was a tandoor in the corner in the shadow of an

acacia tree and I saw a man squatting beside it. He was placing dough on a large wooden spatula

and slapping it against the walls of the _tandoor_. He dropped the dough when he saw me. I had to

make him stop kissing my hands.

“Let me look at you,” I said. He stepped away. He was so tall now--I stood on my toes and still just

came up to his chin. The Bamiyan sun had toughened his skin, and turned it several shades darker

than I remembered, and he had lost a few of his front teeth. There were sparse strands of hair on his

chin. Other than that, he had those same narrow green eyes, that scar on his upper lip, that round

face, that affable smile. You would have recognized him, Amir jan. I am sure of it.

We went inside. There was a young light-skinned Hazara woman, sewing a shawl in a corner of the

room. She was visibly expecting. “This is my wife, Rahim Khan,” Hassan said proudly. “Her name is

Farzana jan.” She was a shy woman, so courteous she spoke in a voice barely higher than a whisper

and she would not raise her pretty hazel eyes to meet my gaze. But the way she was looking at

Hassan, he might as well have been sitting on the throne at the _Arg_.

“When is the baby coming?” I said after we all settled around the adobe room. There was nothing

in the room, just a frayed rug, a few dishes, a pair of mattresses, and a lantern.

“_Inshallah_, this winter,” Hassan said. “I am praying for a boy to carry on my father’s name.”

“Speaking of Ali, where is he?”

Hassan dropped his gaze. He told me that Ali and his cousin--who had owned the house--had been

killed by a land mine two years before, just outside of Bamiyan. A land mine. Is there a more Afghan

way of dying, Amir jan? And for some crazy reason, I became absolutely certain that it had been

Ali’s right leg--his twisted polio leg--that had finally betrayed him and stepped on that land mine. I

was deeply saddened to hear Ali had died. Your father and I grew up together, as you know, and Ali

had been with him as long as I could remember. I remember when we were all little, the year Ali got

polio and almost died. Your father would walk around the house all day crying.

Farzana made us shorwa with beans, turnips, and potatoes. We washed our hands and dipped

fresh _naan_ from the tandoor into the shorwa--it was the best meal I had had in months. It was then

that I asked Hassan to move to Kabul with me. I told him about the house, how I could not care for it

by myself anymore. I told him I would pay him well, that he and his _khanum_ would be comfortable.

They looked to each other and did not say anything. Later, after we had washed our hands and

Farzana had served us grapes, Hassan said the village was his home now; he and Farzana had made

a life for themselves there.

“And Bamiyan is so close. We know people there. Forgive me, Rahim Khan. I pray you

understand.”

“Of course,” I said. “You have nothing to apologize for. I understand.”

It was midway through tea after shorwa that Hassan asked about you. I told him you were in

America, but that I did not know much more. Hassan had so many questions about you. Had you

married? Did you have children? How tall were you? Did you still fly kites and go to the cinema?

Were you happy? He said he had befriended an old Farsi teacher in Bamiyan who had taught him to

read and write. If he wrote you a letter, would I pass it on to you? And did I think you would write

back? I told him what I knew of you from the few phone conversations I had had with your father, but

mostly I did not know how to answer him. Then he asked me about your father. When I told him,

Hassan buried his face in his hands and broke into tears. He wept like a child for the rest of that

night.

They insisted that I spend the night there. Farzana fixed a cot for me and left me a glass of well

water in case I got thirsty. All night, I heard her whispering to Hassan, and heard him sobbing.

In the morning, Hassan told me he and Farzana had decided to move to Kabul with me.

“I should not have come here,” I said. “You were right, Hassan jan. You have a zendagi, a life here.

It was presumptuous of me to just show up and ask you to drop everything. It is me who needs to be

forgiven.”

“We don’t have that much to drop, Rahim Khan,” Hassan said. His eyes were still red and puffy.

“We’ll go with you. We’ll help you take care of the house.”

“Are you absolutely sure?”

He nodded and dropped his head. “Agha sahib was like my second father... God give him peace.”

They piled their things in the center of a few worn rags and tied the corners together. We loaded

the bundle into the Buick. Hassan stood in the threshold of the house and held the Koran as we all

kissed it and passed under it. Then we left for Kabul. I remember as I was pulling away, Hassan

turned to take a last look at their home.

When we got to Kabul, I discovered that Hassan had no intention of moving into the house. “But all

these rooms are empty, Hassan jan. No one is going to live in them,” I said.

But he would not. He said it was a matter of ihtiram, a matter of respect. He and Farzana moved

their things into the hut in the backyard, where he was born. I pleaded for them to move into one of

the guest bedrooms upstairs, but Hassan would hear nothing of it. “What will Amir agha think?” he

said to me. “What will he think when he comes back to Kabul after the war and finds that I have

assumed his place in the house?” Then, in mourning for your father, Hassan wore black for the next

forty days.

I did not want them to, but the two of them did all the cooking, all the cleaning. Hassan tended to

the flowers in the garden, soaked the roots, picked off yellowing leaves, and planted rosebushes. He

painted the walls. In the house, he swept rooms no one had slept in for years, and cleaned

bathrooms no one had bathed in. Like he was preparing the house for someone’s return. Do you

remember the wall behind the row of corn your father had planted, Amir jan? What did you and

Hassan call it, “the Wall of Ailing Corn”? A rocket destroyed a whole section of that wall in the

middle of the night early that fall. Hassan rebuilt the wall with his own hands, brick by brick, until it

stood’ whole again. I do not know what I would have done if he had not been there. Then late that

fall, Farzana gave birth to a stillborn baby girl. Hassan kissed the baby’s lifeless face, and we buried

her in the backyard, near the sweetbrier bushes. We covered the little mound with leaves from the

poplar trees. I said a prayer for her. Farzana stayed in the hut all day and wailed--it is a heartbreaking

sound, Amir jan, the wailing of a mother. I pray to Allah you never hear it.

Outside the walls of that house, there was a war raging. But the three of us, in your father’s house,

we made our own little haven from it. My vision started going by the late 1980s, so I had Hassan read

me your mother’s books. We would sit in the foyer, by the stove, and Hassan would read me from

_Masnawi_ or _Khayyám_, as Farzana cooked in the kitchen. And every morning, Hassan placed a

flower on the little mound by the sweetbrier bushes.

In early 1990, Farzana became pregnant again. It was that same year, in the middle of the summer,

that a woman covered in a sky blue burqa knocked on the front gates one morning. When I walked up

to the gates, she was swaying on her feet, like she was too weak to even stand. I asked her what she

wanted, but she would not answer.

“Who are you?” I said. But she just collapsed right there in the driveway. I yelled for Hassan and he

helped me carry her into the house, to the living room. We lay her on the sofa and took off her burqa.

Beneath it, we found a toothless woman with stringy graying hair and sores on her arms. She looked

like she had not eaten for days. But the worst of it by far was her face. Someone had taken a knife to

it and... Amir jan, the slashes cut this way and that way. One of the cuts went from cheekbone to

hairline and it had not spared her left eye on the way. It was grotesque. I patted her brow with a wet

cloth and she opened her eyes. “Where is Hassan?” she whispered.

“I’m right here,” Hassan said. He took her hand and squeezed it.

Her good eye rolled to him. “I have walked long and far to see if you are as beautiful in the flesh as

you are in my dreams. And you are. Even more.” She pulled his hand to her scarred face. “Smile for

me. Please.”

Hassan did and the old woman wept. “You smiled coming out of me, did anyone ever tell you? And

I wouldn’t even hold you. Allah forgive me, I wouldn’t even hold you.”

None of us had seen Sanaubar since she had eloped with a band of singers and dancers in 1964,

just after she had given birth to Hassan. You never saw her, Amir, but in her youth, she was a vision.

She had a dimpled smile and a walk that drove men crazy. No one who passed her on the street, be it

a man or a woman, could look at her only once. And now...

Hassan dropped her hand and bolted out of the house. I went after him, but he was too fast. I saw

him running up the hill where you two used to play, his feet kicking up plumes of dust. I let him go. I

sat with Sanaubar all day as the sky went from bright blue to purple. Hassan still had not come back

when night fell and moonlight bathed the clouds. Sanaubar cried that coming back had been a

mistake, maybe even a worse one than leaving. But I made her stay. Hassan would return, I knew.

He came back the next morning, looking tired and weary, like he had not slept all night. He took

Sanaubar’s hand in both of his and told her she could cry if she wanted to but she needn’t, she was

home now, he said, home with her family. He touched the scars on her face, and ran his hand

through her hair.

Hassan and Farzana nursed her back to health. They fed her and washed her clothes. I gave her

one of the guest rooms upstairs. Sometimes, I would look out the window into the yard and watch

Hassan and his mother kneeling together, picking tomatoes or trimming a rosebush, talking. They

were catching up on all the lost years, I suppose. As far as I know, he never asked where she had

been or why she had left and she never told. I guess some stories do not need telling.

It was Sanaubar who delivered Hassan’s son that winter of 1990. It had not started snowing yet,

but the winter winds were blowing through the yards, bending the flowerbeds and rustling the

leaves. I remember Sanaubar came out of the hut holding her grandson, had him wrapped in a wool

blanket. She stood beaming under a dull gray sky tears streaming down her cheeks, the needle-cold

wind blowing her hair, and clutching that baby in her arms like she never wanted to let go. Not this

time. She handed him to Hassan and he handed him to me and I sang the prayer of Ayat-ul-kursi in

that little boy’s ear.

They named him Sohrab, after Hassan’s favorite hero from the _Shahnamah_, as you know, Amir

jan. He was a beautiful little boy, sweet as sugar, and had the same temperament as his father. You

should have seen Sanaubar with that baby, Amir jan. He became the center of her existence. She

sewed clothes for him, built him toys from scraps of wood, rags, and dried grass. When he caught a

fever, she stayed up all night, and fasted for three days. She burned isfand for him on a skillet to cast

out nazar, the evil eye. By the time Sohrab was two, he was calling her Sasa. The two of them were

inseparable.

She lived to see him turn four, and then, one morning, she just did not wake up. She looked calm,

at peace, like she did not mind dying now. We buried her in the cemetery on the hill, the one by the

pomegranate tree, and I said a prayer for her too. The loss was hard on Hassan--it always hurts more

to have and lose than to not have in the first place. But it was even harder on little Sohrab. He kept

walking around the house, looking for Sasa, but you know how children are, they forget so quickly.

By then--that would have been 1995--the Shorawi were defeated and long gone and Kabul belonged

to Massoud, Rabbani, and the Mujahedin. The infighting between the factions was fierce and no one

knew if they would live to see the end of the day. Our ears became accustomed to the whistle of

falling shells, to the rumble of gunfire, our eyes familiar with the sight of men digging bodies out of

piles of rubble. Kabul in those days, Amir jan, was as close as you could get to that proverbial hell on

earth. Allah was kind to us, though. The Wazir Akbar Khan area was not attacked as much, so we did

not have it as bad as some of the other neighborhoods.

On those days when the rocket fire eased up a bit and the gunfighting was light, Hassan would take

Sohrab to the zoo to see Marjan the lion, or to the cinema. Hassan taught him how to shoot the

slingshot, and, later, by the time he was eight, Sohrab had become deadly with that thing: He could

stand on the terrace and hit a pinecone propped on a pail halfway across the yard. Hassan taught

him to read and write--his son was not going to grow up illiterate like he had. I grew very attached to

that little boy--I had seen him take his first step, heard him utter his first word. I bought children’s

books for Sohrab from the bookstore by Cinema Park--they have destroyed that too now--and Sohrab

read them as quickly as I could get them to him. He reminded me of you, how you loved to read when

you were little, Amir jan. Sometimes, I read to him at night, played riddles with him, taught him card

tricks. I miss him terribly.

In the wintertime, Hassan took his son kite running. There were not nearly as many kite

tournaments as in the old days--no one felt safe outside for too long--but there were still a few

scattered tournaments. Hassan would prop Sohrab on his shoulders and they would go trotting

through the streets, running kites, climbing trees where kites had dropped. You remember, Amir Jan,

what a good kite runner Hassan was? He was still just as good. At the end of winter, Hassan and

Sohrab would hang the kites they had run all winter on the walls of the main hallway. They would put

them up like paintings.

I told you how we all celebrated in 1996 when the Taliban rolled in and put an end to the daily

fighting. I remember coming home that night and finding Hassan in the kitchen, listening to the radio.

He had a sober look in his eyes. I asked him what was wrong, and he just shook his head. “God help

the Hazaras now, Rahim Khan sahib,” he said.

“The war is over, Hassan,” I said. “There’s going to be peace, _Inshallah_, and happiness and

calm. No more rockets, no more killing, no more funerals!” But he just turned off the radio and asked

if he could get me anything before he went to bed.

A few weeks later, the Taliban banned kite fighting. And two years later, in 1998, they massacred

the Hazaras in Mazar-i-Sharif.
